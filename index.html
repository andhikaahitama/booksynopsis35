Morley captures the greatest moments from across Bowie&#x2019;s life and career; how young Davie Jones of South London became the international David Bowie; his pioneering collaborations in the recording studio with the likes of Tony Visconti, Mick Ronson, and Brian Eno; to iconic live, film, theatre, and television performances from the 1970s, 80s, and 90s, as well as the various encounters and artistic relationships he developed with musicians from John Lennon, Lou Reed, and Iggy Pop to Trent Reznor and Arcade Fire. And of course, discusses in detail his much-heralded and critically acclaimed finale with the release of <i>Blackstar</i> just days before his shocking death in New York.<br> <br>Morley offers a startling biographical critique of David Bowie&#x2019;s legacy, showing how he never stayed still even when he withdrew from the spotlight, how he always knew his own worth, and released a dazzling plethora of personalities, concepts, and works into the world with a single-minded determination and a voluptuous imagination to create something the likes of which the world had never seen before&#x2014;and likely will never see again.</p><p>Writer, broadcaster, and cultural critic PAUL MORLEY has written about music, art, and entertainment since the 1970s. A founding member of the electronic collective Art of Noise and a member of staff at the Royal Academy of Music, he is the author of&nbsp;<i>Ask: Chatter of Pop</i>;&nbsp;<i>Words and Music: A History of Pop in the Shape of a City</i>;&nbsp;<i>Piece by Piece: Writing About Joy Division 1977&#x2013;2007</i>;&nbsp;<i>Earthbound</i>;&nbsp;<i>The North</i>;&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Nothing</i>, and he collaborated with music icon Grace Jones on her memoir,<i>&nbsp;I&#x2019;ll Never Write My Memoirs</i>.The Age of Bowie INTRODUCTION: STRANGE FASCINATION<p></p> <br>He is backing into a dark forbidding wardrobe and closing the door on himself at the end of the video to &#x2018;Lazarus&#x2019;, a tranquil story of life and death, told in reverse . . . The idea had been suggested to him by someone on the shoot. At first, he is not sure whether it is something he wants to do. Then he smiles and decides, yes. I&#x2019;ll do that. &#x2018;That will keep them guessing,&#x2019; he says, always a kidder. It will look like a final exit. The very end of a true story. Of the journey of a man whose alternate selves took him on a fantastic adventure through space, time and sexuality. Everybody knows him now, and he is going somewhere else.<br> <br>He hides himself . . . Inside the cupboard, there&#x2019;s a tomblike darkness. There is nothing much to do. He pulls off his wig with a sigh of relief, pleased to be momentarily relinquishing the burden of playing someone else. His mind starts to race as he stands there, in the dark, wondering about what in fact people might think, about the agitated way he moves backwards, the way his eyes are obscured in the video, and how he only sort of breathes. It feels like he&#x2019;s fallen out of history. While I&#x2019;m here waiting, he thinks, it&#x2019;s a good job that there is a lot to think about. A lot to remember, if I haven&#x2019;t forgotten. A lot of things that I&#x2019;ve done. A lot of books I&#x2019;ve read. A lot of places I&#x2019;ve visited. The people I&#x2019;ve known. The strangeness of the world. It makes my brain whirl. I could think about my life for a thousand years.<br> <br>He patiently stands in the quiet dark and shuts his eyes. He imagines he is alone on a stage, and about to sing a song to an audience in front of him, anticipating his next move, his every move, reading so much into every gesture and word, into every thought, because some believe they can hear him think. He thinks about what he will sing, about what the opening line will be . . . he takes a deep breath . . . he opens his eyes and it seems to be darker inside than when he first climbed in . . . he hears a voice . . .<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>It is 1970, I am thirteen, and at some point during the year I hear the name David Bowie spoken for the very first time. I come to realise that someone called David Bowie is alive. I knew nothing about him, but I began to notice that there was someone on the planet with that name. The name seemed very ordinary, but something about it meant it cut right through to where I was, and cut deep. The surname made an everyday David seem much sharper. Somehow you caught sight of your own reflection in the name, and something else, which you couldn&#x2019;t yet make out.<br> <br>When I heard him sing for the first time, not long after I had heard someone say his name &#x2013; &#x2018;here&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Supermen&#x201d; by David Bowie, when all the world was very young&#x2019; &#x2013; he had a voice that felt made up of unusual things, one that pierced straight to the heart of me. It was something that my brain was clearly missing. The sound of him put me on high alert, and I thought here was definitely someone I should get to know. I didn&#x2019;t know much about anything at the time, and was at the very early stages of working out who I was and what on earth I was going to do with myself, but he really caught my attention.<br> <br>I found him, and at the same time, he found me; he was, I was soon to understand as I discovered more about him, on an almost desperate, conquistadorial mission to find as many listeners and fans as he could, to fill in the blanks inside him he felt were blotting out his soul, which meant he needed to be found. To find some fans, and at the beginning just a few would be fine, he was devising new sorts of ways he could be found and once found never ignored.<br> <br>During the 1999 commencement address he delivered at Berklee College of Music in Boston after receiving an honorary doctorate, he would say that as a musician he had been &#x2018;on a crusade to change the kind of information that rock music contained&#x2019;. He confided that growing up he adored John Coltrane, Harry Partch, Eric Dolphy, the Velvet Underground, John Cage and Sonny Stitt. &#x2018;Unfortunately, I also loved Anthony Newley, Florence Foster Jenkins, Johnnie Ray, Julie London, Legendary Stardust Cowboy, Edith Piaf and Shirley Bassey,&#x2019; he went on, referring to that part of him that would consistently disrupt his enduring, probing curiosity for the obscure and transitional.<br> <br>Music, he discovered, was a great game of &#x2018;what if&#x2019;. &#x2018;What happens if you combined Brecht/Weill musical drama with rhythm and blues? What happens if you transplant the French chanson with the Philly sound? Will Little Richard lie comfortably with Schoenberg? Can you put haggis and snails on the same plate? Well, no, but some of these ideas worked out very well.&#x2019;<br> <br>As a boy without then knowing who any of these people were &#x2013; except Shirley Bassey, mostly for singing &#x2018;Goldfinger&#x2019;, contributing appreciable glamour to the provisional myth of James Bond &#x2013; what first pulled me in was his potentially deranged blend of something warped and deeply thoughtful with a definite, kinky show-business flourish. The mixing and merging of the strange with the familiar, mortal grossness with the airy spirit, sounded like nothing else I&#x2019;d heard &#x2013; and ultimately ever would hear &#x2013; because there were few others so drawn to both the offbeat and the ostentatious. It&#x2019;s very rare for a performer to cross so easily from the experimental to the opulent and the embellished, infatuated with artifice and excess but possessing an inquisitive, militant spirit. Both ends of the spectrum, the freely chaotic or the defiantly melodic, the so-called good or bad taste, could make the mind spin through very interesting changes and make constant new discoveries.<br> <br>To find Bowie as a teenager, and be found by him, was incredible, and, perhaps, inevitable. At that point, those of us becoming teenagers in the early 1970s needed something of our own, having been too young to catch the 1960s. We&#x2019;d missed the Beatles, we&#x2019;d missed the Stones &#x2013; as something that belonged and spoke directly to us. Bowie wasn&#x2019;t, though, that easy to find in the early 1970s, when music was not everywhere, all the time, instantly available with a swipe or a jab, where every day was yet to be packed with endlessly available event, product and entertainment.<br> <br>Nothing was then easy to find when you were in your early teenage years hemmed in by parents, school and a solid set of very fixed expectations. There were few places to find the new, and what places there were tended to be hard to find, out of sight, needing some form of permission or disobedience to access. Difference was hidden; you had to work hard to get there.<br> <br>I had heard Bowie in the background the year before I started to develop an insatiable interest in pop music, thinking of his hit song &#x2018;Space Oddity&#x2019;, but that had been one of those songs that just appeared, closely harnessed to the climax of the 1960s space race, and then disappeared, as though it wasn&#x2019;t actually by anyone. It was conceived by committee especially for the occasion. Men landed on the moon, and occasionally as the astonishing footage was shown, you could hear the song, as though the man on the moon and the singer of the song was called Major Tom.<br> <br>I first heard his name said across the airwaves on self-proclaimed &#x2018;wonderful&#x2019; BBC Radio 1. This was the central place where you came across pop music at the time; one of the only places, especially when you were too young to go out to clubs and concerts. The one place to actually see pop was the weekly half-hour Top of the Pops, a family show where smuggled into its wholesome midst were stunning signs and sightings of the mysterious underground you heard tantalising rumours about at school, whispered through names of groups and seen on album sleeves that had a touch of witchcraft about them. Top of the Pops would feature dramatically deranged-looking rock musicians using lively, immediate pop songs to sing about lust, paranoia, fear, anger, rebellion, mystery, because if it was in the charts, it would be broadcast. That was the rule.<br> <br>It didn&#x2019;t matter how long the hair of the male lead singer, how outlandish and dubious the clothes, how obviously stoned-seeming the drummer, how subversive the lyrics, being a hit gave it a free pass directly into the home of millions of viewers courtesy of a relatively generous BBC policy.<br> <br>Even the Who, demanding that you all f-f-f-fade away, a classic, unholy four-letter word teetering on the lippy tip of flailing singer Roger Daltrey&#x2019;s tongue, had made it through onto what was essentially a souped-up variety show. A programme generally watched after a shared teatime in the same room by parents and their children, silently appraising a random parade of performances that meant very different things to the different generations in the empty spaces of their mind waiting to be filled, or emptied further.<br> <br>These occasional insubordinate cameos by groups wearing the clothes and expressions of revolutionary spirits gave the whole procedure the edge of something that challenged the apparently secure nature of the relationship between child and adult, between teenager and the everlasting normal society they were expected to enter without a second thought. There was a general sense as these occasional surreal bombs exploded in the middle of ordinary British houses on ordinary British streets that it wasn&#x2019;t really happening, and even if it was, it would all soon be over and normal service would be resumed.<br> <br>Bowie, though, in 1970 was more in that distantly rumbling underground, his travels then limited to the smaller, dirtier venues and mundane local halls and clubs across the land, separated from any possible appearance on Top of the Pops. He was out there somewhere, but I could never find him. I would discover that once in the late 1960s after a late-night folk club performance in Stockport where I lived he missed the last train and had to sleep on the platform overnight. This meant we were to an extent sleeping together, under the same clouds, or sleeping only separated by a couple of miles. It took me forty years to learn that. At the time he might as well have been orbiting Saturn for all I knew.<br> <br>A young, naive teenager didn&#x2019;t yet possess the understanding of how to break into that impenetrable-seeming underground. What clothes were necessary, how long should your hair be, did you need special words, a knowledge of arcane symbols? Pop music cliques then by their very nature contained a rarefied inner elite that seemed impossible to join.<br> <br>Bowie wasn&#x2019;t then getting much if any play on the radio. Except to a few loyal followers, he wasn&#x2019;t that well known, despite having had the surprise top 10 song the year before, quickly forgotten in the way things were back then, because life seemed to be moving fast into the future and a few months could make the difference between having your hit and being forgotten.<br> <br>His hit might even have cost him his few hard-core fans, as they were the sort of discriminating, or snobby, music lovers who viewed commercial hits as a sign of artistic worthlessness. The world then was clearly divided between the album and the single. Rock already had its own equivalent of the highbrow versus lowbrow battle. One side, it had been decided, had more value than the other. Albums were serious; singles were trivial. Those of us that slipped naturally between the two worlds were viewed at the time as extremely weak-minded. For those that did slip more easily between the two worlds, it seemed a very good way to locate the future.<br> <br>Constructing an idea of the future &#x2013; any future within reason, even if it had its own problems &#x2013; was vital at the time, a pushing away from a disorientating war that your parents and their parents were still suffering from, the gloom, conflicts, monotony and general effects that were hard to escape. Mainstream society and culture was committed to maintaining itself as it was for its own security but coming under pressure.<br> <br>An alternative future was slowly taking shape around life in the 1950s, so that the basic, dreary flatness of the nation was showing the first electric signs of the shapes, colours and attitudes about to dominate the world, and propel it into a very different age altogether. A storm of progress was brewing. This was pop culture beginning to make its way to the centre of everything, and introducing a global informality, a new world order of noise and image.<br> <br>Rock music, a warning sign in the mid-Fifties, an invading force by the mid-Sixties, was helping the young escape the pressure from elsewhere, its exponents and fans relishing and celebrating not just the new possibilities of personal freedom and independent thinking. They were also keeping a vigilant eye on those freedoms and independence being interfered with by those who tended to be responsible for wars and miscellaneous national and international crack-ups. In the grander scheme of things, to transcend the effects of the war, incite a galvanising sense of optimism, it was needing something outrageous and difficult to believe, like the Americans flying to the moon, and walking on it, and beaming the evidence back to earth and the television sets that were themselves an invading force.<br> <br>Rock and pop could supply equivalent capsule moments of adventure and wonder, with images that in their own way were as vividly of the moment as an astronaut planted in a moonscape. Sometimes the incongruous impact of pop could seem as strange to a young mind separated from wider, more poetic and artistic influences as the classic image Karlheinz Stockhausen had used when he described his 1955 work Gesang der J�nglinge (&#x2018;Song of the Youths&#x2019;) mixing up human voice with electronics as being like &#x2018;finding an apple on the moon&#x2019; &#x2013; an ordinary thing being transplanted into an extraordinary place. (Oddly enough the moon landing itself in 1969 as shown on television had the quality of being an apple found on the moon. There were no apples. The astronauts were the apples. When Jethro Tull appeared on Top of the Pops, like frugal New Age farmers from Narnia, they were the apples, and Top of the Pops was the moon.)<br> <br>The future arrived down on earth through music, which could then take you to another planet. Bowie symbolised the future first of all when you heard the sound of his voice, and then when you saw him, in a photograph, or, eventually, on the TV, his appearance sealed the deal. You could see it in his eyes; mixed in with his own sense of amusement, anxiety and engagement, there was something else, perhaps the weirdly attained wisdom of the ages, reflected straight back at you.<br> <br>Your mind was rearranged, as it turned out it needed to be, even if it hadn&#x2019;t been when you had only heard him. When I first saw him &#x2013; and everyone remembers the first time they laid eyes on him performing, and what Bowie, at what period of time &#x2013; I&#x2019;m not sure it was something I actually explicitly thought or spoke out loud, but there was definitely a feeling of, in the middle of all the everyday gloom, tension and endless school routine . . . I could be like that. I could go there, or somewhere close. Not that I would dye my hair, brighten my face with cosmetics, trace mystical shapes with my fingers, wear flowing robes and Turkish shoes, matter-of-factly claim to be from out there to fulfil a special mission through music, to recreate the cosmic order, but in my own way, I could find my own way.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Because his music wasn&#x2019;t specifically cheerful enough, or straightforward and conventionally comfort...</p><h2>Finding God: Our Response to God&#39;s Gifts - Grade 4</h2><p>25 sessions covering sections on: God, Our Creator and Father / Jesus, Our Lord and Savior / The Church, Our Community in the Spirit / Sacraments, Our Way of Life / Morality, Our Lived Faith.

Illustrated with watercolours, this journal contains a selection of these diaries. Poyntz writes about how the Burren changes through the seasons of the year. She describes in detail the animals and birds of the countryside and seashore, capturing the beauty of the rare and diverse wild flowers for which the Burren is so famous. She also speaks about her friends and neighbours and life in the village of Ballyvaughan.

Its author was a man of sophistication and erudition even though he was not given to virtuoso displays of either quality. He created this novel out of his personal and artistic needs, and out of his sense of the need of Japan and the world community to know the story he tells in it. Japan has been richly served by the original. But Toson had a worldwide as well as a Japanese audience in mind when he wrote <i>Before the Dawn.</i> This translation has been done in the hope of contributing to that undertaking.<br><br>"<i>Before the Dawn</i> looks back on the adventure, turmoil, and tragedy of the mid-nineteenth century with a clear and unsentimental vision, but it speaks of those times in tones of tact, humility, and deference. It is a celebration of the humanity of its characters and the richness, complexity, and diversity of the lives they lived during the final years of the Tokugawa shogunate and the first two decades of the Meiji era. For all the weight of its historical concerns, it maintains its lyrical tone even when the subject is external threat, internal political turmoil, the grinding hardship of maintaining the old post system, or the bitter disappointments that the new age brought so many of those who had worked hardest and sacrificed most to bring it into being. It has been followed not only by scholarly studies but also by an immense outpouring of historical fiction, family and local histories, and other publications drawing on the rich store of old diaries and official records preserved throughout the country. These later works often illuminate the period from points of view that were not accessible to any of Toson&#x2019;s characters, but <i>Before the Dawn</i> remains the standard against which all others are measured." &#x2015;from the Introduction</p></p><p><b>William E.

The timelessness of myth is conveyed through Cousineau's discussions of the mythology of travel, mentors, cities, baseball, and vampires.</p></p><p>Myths, explains filmmaker and author Phil Cousineau in, are stories that belong to the "once and the future" because they evoke "the timeless concerns of human beings--birth, death, time, good, and evil, creativity and destruction." In his excellent <i>Once and Future Myths</i>, the author of <i>The Art of Pilgrimage</i> shows readers how mythology continues to affect and shape contemporary life. Myths are also forces to be reckoned with. Unless we become aware of the myths unfolding in our personal lives, "we run the risk of being controlled by them," he warns.<p> As his mentor Joseph Campbell once did, Cousineau often draws from pop culture to help readers understand modern myths and how they influence us. In a chapter entitled "The Myth of the Creative Struggle," he shows how Frank Sinatra mythologized urban life by "making our loneliness and our struggle seem sacred, and triumph possible." Yet Cousineau is most profound when he casts a mythic eye toward his own simple life. In a tender passage about taking his son to the ballpark, he gives words to the irresistible appeal and mythology of sports. Whether you are a writer grappling with understanding the subtext of life, a seeker who yearns to know your soul's true story, or are simply a fan of all things mythic, this is a highly recommend resource and a delight to read. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>Phil Cousineau is a bestselling author, editor, photographer, award-winning documentary filmmaker, adventure travel leader, and independant scholar who lectures around the world on a wide range of topics from mythology, mentorship, and soul.

Original.</p><p>An idyllic small town setting is no protection against terror in this tale of painter/interior decorator Claire Malvern and her husband Keith, who leave the pressures of urban life and the corporate world to pursue their dream of opening a rural B&amp;B fishing lodge in the Pacific Northwest. When Keith disappears from bed one night and is later found drowned in the thundering Bloodroot Falls, his death is ruled a suicide by the local sheriff, widower Nick Braden. But Claire is convinced otherwise, and gradually, as her investigations bring ominous secrets to light, Nick begins to agree. Harper (The Stone Garden, etc.) has a fantastic flair for creating and sustaining suspense. By the book's climax, virtually everyone in the region seems a viable suspect, even legendary real-life airplane hijacker D.B. Cooper and Sasquatch. But there's perspiration as well as inspiration involved in building the narrative tension; what makes the author's dramatic plot turns truly work is painstaking background research. This deft knitting of fact and fiction enables Harper to describe everything from wilderness survival to supernatural lore with the kind of detail that convinces readers anything is possible. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Protect Your Garden: Eco-Friendly Solutions for Healthy Plants</h2><p>What's happening in your garden?

Originally written for a magazine in 1897, The War of the Worlds became an instant, popular favorite. Long before our modern fascination with flying saucers and brightly glowing UFOs, H. G. Wells anticipated a close encounter between puny Earthlings and seemingly all-powerful Martians. A flash of light observed coming from the red planet sets the stage for a terrifying invasion, against which Earth&#x2019;s modern weapons are useless. Throughout the epic battle, Wells points out that humans just might not have the talent or ability to defeat an extraterrestrial rival. Could we become slaves to a race of alien monsters? Will their heat-ray destroy all of London and decimate the rest of civilization? Can one man save the world? The War of the Worlds is a science fiction masterpiece that has fascinated us for more than a century, through at least three different movies, the infamous Orson Welles radio broadcast, and even a Broadway musical. Few books have captured the popular imagination as forcefully as this H. G. Wells novel.</p><p>This is the granddaddy of all alien invasion stories, first published by H.G. Wells in 1898. The novel begins ominously, as the lone voice of a narrator tells readers that "No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's..." <p> Things then progress from a series of seemingly mundane reports about odd atmospheric disturbances taking place on Mars to the arrival of Martians just outside of London. At first the Martians seem laughable, hardly able to move in Earth's comparatively heavy gravity even enough to raise themselves out of the pit created when their spaceship landed. But soon the Martians reveal their true nature as death machines 100-feet tall rise up from the pit and begin laying waste to the surrounding land. Wells quickly moves the story from the countryside to the evacuation of London itself and the loss of all hope as England's military suffers defeat after defeat. With horror his narrator describes how the Martians suck the blood from living humans for sustenance, and how it's clear that man is not being conquered so much a corralled. <i>--Craig E.

The object of his inquiry was the new class of salaried employees who populated the cities of Weimar Germany.<br><br>Spiritually homeless, divorced from all custom and tradition, these white-collar workers sought refuge in entertainment&#x2014;or the &#x201c;distraction industries,&#x201d; as Kracauer put it&#x2014;but, only three years later, were to flee into the arms of Adolf Hitler. Eschewing the instruments of traditional sociological scholarship, but without collapsing into mere journalistic reportage, Kracauer explores the contradictions of this caste. Drawing on conversations, newspapers, adverts and personal correspondence, he charts the bland horror of the everyday. In the process he succeeds in writing not just a prescient account of the declining days of the Weimar Republic, but also a path-breaking exercise in the sociology of culture which has sharp relevance for today.</p><p><b>Siegfried Kracauer</b> (1889&#x2013;1966) was one of Germany&#x2019;s leading cultural commentators and essayists.<br><br><b>Quintin Hoare</b> is the director of the Bosnian Institute and has translated numerous works by Sartre, Antonio Gramsci, and other French authors.

Her books have won numerous awards, including Reader&#39;s Choice.Though successful, Margaret decided to leave behind the secular publishing world to follow God&#39;s will for her: to write inspirational fiction. Since then she has published the Rocky Creek series and A Lady Like Sarah was a Romance Writers of America RITA finalist.Happily married to her real life hero, Margaret and her husband have three grown children and live in Southern California.Starred Review. In the exquisitely intriguing finale to her Brides of Last Chance Ranch trilogy, Brownley blends faith and romance with a dash of mystery to serve up a cozy, fulfilling story set in the Arizona Territory of the 1890s. Miranda Hunt is a female Pinkerton continuing in her deceased father's footsteps. Miranda is sent to investigate the biggest case of her life&#x2014;she must determine the identity of a train robber known only as the Phantom. In her guise as Annie Beckman, auditioning to inherit a ranch owned by cantankerous and heirless rancher Eleanor Walker, she encounters myriad different personalities, but none as attractive as the mysterious ranch hand known as David Branch. Suspicion vies with attraction as the pair engage in a battle of wits as old as time, even with time running out to catch a thief. This enchanting account of the hardships and wonders of the Old West features many delightful characters. The story stands on its own merits, independent of the first two in the series, drawing readers into a world that is difficult to leave. Agent: Natasha Kern, Natasha Kern Literary Agency.

A typical spread includes crisply detailed color photos of a major building, a ruin (serving as a cutaway), or a model (Wren's 1674 proposal for St. Paul's); photos and drawings of decorative and structural details; a brief paragraph overview; and dozens of terms for the architectural elements depicted. As a survey of styles and of the wealth of specialized vocabulary used to describe them, this is a rich source. For knowledgeable readers, it provides hundreds of fine visual examples, many traceable through the index: friezes appear in 11 settings. For those less sophisticated, the visual definition will often not be enough- -e.g., there's no way to tell whether ``fixed light'' refers to part of a window frame, the glass, or the fact that it doesn't open; nor do any of the three depictions of the ``mortise'' and ``tenon'' make it clear that one is a cavity into which the other fits. Some basic ideas are also missing: the Romans' use of the arch is described with no mention of its enormous structural significance. An attractive, often fascinating source, but one that demands a conventional dictionary as a supplement. Index. (Nonfiction. 10+) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Everyone said he was a good kid: a bit of a clown, maybe not too serious about his studies, but sweet and kind and quick to make friends. When, as a clean-cut teenager, he signed up with the army, the people of Reeds Springs, Missouri, expected to hear nothing but good things about R.J. and Lexie Mease's eldest son.<br><br>It wouldn't work out that way. Darrell Mease would end up on the front lines of the Vietnam War and would come home a drug addict. Over the personally tumultuous, drifting decades that followed, he'd make a new name for himself in the Ozarks: as a tough drug dealer. Then, in 1987, he gunned down a 69-year-old meth kingpin, his wife, and their 20-year-old paraplegic grandson. After a desperate cross-country escape, he was captured, hauled back to Missouri, and sentenced to death for his crimes.<br><br>In jail, Mease experienced a religious conversion, and he made a shocking prediction: he would be saved by miraculous intervention.<br><br>No one believed it would happen. But it did. <br><br>On January 27, 1999, Pope John Paul II visited St. Louis and spoke to Missouri's then-governor, Mel Carnahan. It was the same date that authorities had set for Mease's execution. The pope asked that he be spared. Carnahan agreed.<br><br></p><p><br>A GOOD BOY TURNED BAD...<br>Kind, well-liked, and a good student, Darrell Mease was the pride of his tiny Ozarks town of Reeds Spring, Missouri. His mother even thought Darrell had a special calling and might be a preacher someday. But when he returned from the Vietnam War, everyone agreed something had changed in him. Darrell was no longer the even-tempered, sweet kid they all remembered, but instead a heavy drinker who soon became immersed in the drug underworld.<br><br>A BRUTAL TRIPLE MURDER...<br>Drug dealer Lloyd Lawrence was accustomed to getting his own way, especially when someone double-crossed him. So when Darrell Mease fled with a hefty stash of Lawrence's crank, methamphetamine, he took a contract out on the Vietnam Vet. But Lawrence had underestimated Darrell, who got tired of running and decided to fix the problem once and for all. He drove back to Missouri and gunned down Lawrence on his property along with his wife and paraplegic grandson. <br><br>A LIFE SAVED...<br> It wasn't long before authorities caught up with Darrell and his young girlfriend on the run. Convicted of murder, he was sentenced to die by lethal injection. In prison, Darrell found his faith again and became convinced that "God was his lawyer" and would save him from execution. Many thought he was living in a fantasy world. But the miracle Darrell was waiting for finally happened when in a bizarre twist of fate, he received a death row intervention from none other than the visiting Pope John Paul II... <br><br>"A fascinating-and often chilling read."<br>--<i>MSNBC</i><br><br>"Crisp, informative, and evocative...compelling, vibrant, rich with winning details."<br>--<i>The Washington Post</i><br><br><br>MICHAEL W.

Here, 39 stories - 35 by Lovecraft, and four by three authors he influenced so deeply - Robert E. Howard (two) and Clark Ashton Smith and Robert Bloch (one each). Octavo, black boards embossed with a green metallic design by the Flame Tree Studio based on artwork by Slava Gerj and Gabor Ruszkai, decorative endpapers, 480 pp. An extraordinarily handsome - and dread-inducing itself - decorative edition.

Kaminsky, the veteran author of more than forty novels and the creator of such wonderful characters as Abe Lieberman, Toby Peters, and Inpsector Rostnikov, has created a new PI: Lew Fonesca, a world-weary guy who got in a car and just started driving after his wife died and wound up in front of a Dairy Queen in Sarasota, Florida. <br><br>He now makes his way amid bail jumpers and lost wives, people who want to be found and those who will do anything to stay under their rock. He spends his days solving cases both big and small and trying to get by, while attempting to figure out how to make the rest of his life make sense. <br><br><i>Retribution</i> not only picks up where the first novel in the series, Vengeance, left off, but raises the bar big-time. Lew has solved his share of cases, and most of them-to his pride-have wound up having happy endings; in Vengeance, he saved a young runaway who has had a childhood nobody should ever have, and she finally seems to be turning her life around. But when she becomes involved with a reclusive best selling author and several valuable manuscripts disappear, Lew knows that young Melanie is in way over her head. And if he doesn't act fast, not only could a few reputations get tarnished--the bodies might start piling up.<br></p><p>Stuart M. Kaminsky is the Edgar Award-winning author of the critically acclaimed Inspector Rostnikov, Toby Peters, Lew Fonesca, and Abe Lieberman mystery series. He lives with his family in Sarasota, Florida.<br>1<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The left side of face hurt.<br>A woman named Roberta Dreemer, affectionately known to her few friends and many enemies as Bubbles, had filled the doorway of her rusting trailer in the mobile home park just across from the Pines Nursing Home seconds after I knocked. Bubbles Dreemer was a very big woman.<br>She had been easy to find. She had a phone and it was listed in the Sarasota phone directory. It seemed like a quick, easy job for Richard Tycinker, attorney-at-law in the firm of Tycinker, Oliver and Schwartz with offices on Palm Avenue who needed Big Bubbles's testimony in an assault case.<br>I handed Bubbles the folded sheet. She looked at it for a beat and hit me. Then she slammed her door.<br>It was a Thursday. Still morning. I was sitting by myself in a booth at the back of the Crisp Dollar Bill, almost directly across from my office/home on Washington Street, better known as 301. I was doing my best to forget Bubbles Dreemer. I'm not good at forgetting. That is one reason I see Ann Horowitz, the shrink treating me for depression.<br>I had bicycled to the trailer park and back to save the cost of a car rental. From where I lived and worked I could bike or walk to almost anything I needed or wanted in Sarasota. Before I went into the Crisp Dollar Bill I had stopped at the Main Street Book Store, the largest remaindered bookstore in Florida, gone up to the third floor, and bought a two-videotape 1940 serial of <i>The Shadow</i> starring Victor Jory. It took six dollars of my fifty. I was using some of what was left on a beer and a Philly steak sandwich that, thanks to Bubbles, was a little painful to eat.<br>My name is Lew Fonesca. When people look at me, they see a five-foot-seven, thin, balding man, a little over forty years old with a distinctly Italian, distinctly sad face. That's what I see when I look in the mirror, which I do my best to avoid.<br>I came to Florida five years ago from Chicago after my wife died in a hit-and-run accident on Lake Shore Drive. I was headed for Key West. My wife, whose name I've spoken only twice since she died, was a lawyer. I was an investigator in the office of the state's attorney of Cook County. My specialty was finding people. I'm not a cop. I'm not a lawyer. I'm not a private investigator. I'm not even an accountant.<br>My car had died in the parking lot of the Dairy Queen that I could see from the booth in which I was sitting at the Crisp Dollar Bill if I leaned to my right and looked through the amber window. Thirty feet from where my car died, there had been a "FOR LET" sign on the run-down two-floor office building at the back of the DQ parking lot. I had rented a small two-room office on the second floor, converted the small reception room into an underfurnished office and the equally small office behind it into the place I slept, read, watched television and videotapes, and thought about the past.<br>My goal in life was simple. To be left alone. To make enough to keep me in breakfast, burgers, videotapes, an occasional movie, and payments to my shrink.<br>Almost all my meals were eaten within a few hundred yards of where I lived, worked, and watched old movies on tape. There was Gwen's Diner at the junction of 41 and 301 where a big photograph of young Elvis in white smiled out in black and white with a proud sign under it that said, "Elvis Presley ate here in 1959." There was the DQ owned I by a sun-weathered man named Dave who spent most of his time alone in his small boat in the Gulf of Mexico. And there was the Crisp Dollar Bill where the bartender and I owner Billy Hopsman played an endless series of tapes and CDs he loved that seemed to have nothing in common. There was Mel Torme, Verdi operas, the Pointer Sisters, Linda Ronstadt, Ruben Blades, B. B. King, Blue Grass, Dinah Washington, Sinatra, and odd German stuff that sounded like Kurt Weill gone into a depression not far from my own. You never knew who you might hear from the I Bose speakers when you entered the Crisp Dollar Bill. Right now it was Joe Williams singing "Don't Be Mad at I Me." Billy had been a hippie, a cabdriver, and for a brief time a minor league catcher with a very minor league Detroit Tigers farm team. Best of all, Billy was not a talker. He wasn't much of a listener either except for his large collection of tapes.<br>The door of the Crisp Dollar Bill opened and in walked Marvin Uliaks. Actually, you couldn't call Marvin's mode of transportation "walking." It was much closer to a shuffle. In this case, a nervous shuffle.<br>Marvin had brought an unwelcome blast of sun behind him reminding me that there were hours to go before I could call it a day.<br>"Close the door," Billy said automatically without looking up from the copy of the Sarasota <i>Herald-Tribune</i> laid out on the bar in front of him.<br>Marvin shifted the weight of the oversized book under his arm, pulled himself together, and closed the door. Then he squinted, blinked, and tried to adjust his eyes to the amber darkness.<br>Marvin's nose was pushed to one side as if his face were permanently pressed against a store window. His large popping eyes made him look amazed at even the most inconsequential contact with other human beings. Marvin was short, had an unkempt mess of brown hair beginning to show gray at the temples, and was so thin that you wondered how well he could stand up against an evening breeze off the Gulf. I imagined Marvin in a hurricane, arms out, hair blowing as he went spinning in the air, a startled look on his face as he passed the same cow Dorothy had seen on her way to Oz.<br>Marvin had the kind of face that made people say, "He'll never win a beauty contest." As I was soon to discover, people were once again wrong. The great "they," the ones we mean when we say "they say," were often wrong but completely protected by being someone other than you and me.<br>Marvin's eyes adjusted quickly and he headed straight for my booth. He dropped the huge book in front of me and sat facing me across the table. The pockets of his well-weathered denim jacket were as bulged out as his eyes. He folded his hands in front of him on the table and looked at me.<br>"Look at it," Marvin said.<br>He was harmless and quiet, two levels below minimally bright. I pushed my <i>Shadow</i> videos aside and opened what was clearly an album of photographs and newspaper clippings. The first item was a newspaper clipping that said Marvin Uliaks, age three, had won the annual cutest child contest at the county fair in Ocala in 1957. The article, wiltingly Scotch-taped in the album like every other item, had a photograph of a smiling blond kid with curly hair wearing a sailor suit. The kid was pointing at the camera and beaming. Flanking the little boy were a thin, sober-looking man with a baby in his arms and a pretty brunette who was holding Marvin's free hand. The woman wore a little hat and held her free hand up to shield out the sun. The man and woman were identified as the proud parents of Marvin.<br>"That's me all right," Marvin said, tapping a finger on the newspaper clipping. "My mother, my father, and my baby sister.<br>"My sister, Vera Lynn. She was named for a singer."<br>"'Till We Meet Again.'" I said.<br>"Don't know where, don't know when," Marvin sang. Vera Lynn, the British singer during World War II, was a favorite of my father's who made it through the ware with all his organs and body parts except his right eye.<br>"Look at the next one," Marvin said with excitement.<br>In the photograph, Marvin's father was holding the little blond boy upside down by the ankles. The father had a little smile. The boy was grinning.<br>"Turn the album upside down," Marvin said, turning the album. "See, now I look right side up and my father looks upside down."<br>"You're the right," I said, turning the album around again.<br>"Marvin, what...?"<br>"Keep looking, Mr. Fonseca. Keep looking," he urged, turning the page."<br>"Fonesca,r; I corrected.<br>"Yeah, oh, sorry. My name's Uliaks."<br>"I know." I said, looking at several pages of photographs that meant nothing to me.<br>"I went to your office," Marvin said. "You weren't there. I went to Gwen's. You weren't there either. I went..."<br>"You found me," I said.<br>"Yes," he said, shaking his head once with pride.<br>"Why?" I reached for my beer.<br>"I want you to find Vera Lynn."<br>"You want me to find your sister," I said, putting the beer down. "I'm a process server. I find people to give them orders to appear at court or in a lawyer's office for a deposition, or to produce documents. I'm not a private investigator."<br>"You find people," Marvin said. "I heard. Old guy at Gwen's told me."<br>"A few times," I said. "A few times I found some people."<br>"There, there she is," he said, tapping on a photograph on the page I had just turned to. He was tapping on the color photograph of a very pretty and very well sculptured blonde in a blue dress. The girl was smiling. Her teeth looked white and perfect. I guessed she was no more than eighteen. Another girl about the same age stood next to the blonde. She was pretty, thin, wearing a red dress and no smile.<br>"Who's the other one?"<br>Marvin craned his neck awkwardly to get a better view at the photograph with a look of amazement as if he were seeing it for the first time.<br>"Sarah," he said. "She's been dead a long time. I need to find Vera Lynn."<br>He was looking at me and rocking back and forth.<br>"When was the last time you saw Vera Lynn?" I asked.<br>He bit his lower lip considering the question.<br>"Twenty, twenty-five years maybe. I got a letter."<br>He reached over and turned the album pages quickly past yellowed notes, withering photographs, cracking postcards, matchbooks, and some candy wrappers.<br>"Here," he said, triumphantly slapping the page he was looking for with the palm of his hand.<br>I was looking down at an envelope.<br>I had come to the Crisp Dollar Bill to have a sandwich, a beer, and to feel sorry for myself, not for Marvin Uliaks. I removed the letter from the envelope.<br>Marvin fidgeted around and leaned forward getting nearly on top of me.<br>"Letter's from Vera Lynn," he said, pointing to the neatly scripted name in the corner of the envelope I had laid aside. "She's not in Ocala no more. She's not in Dayton no more. I called, asked. Long time ago. I looked for her couple of times. Took the bus or a car out of Ocala after the wedding."<br>I was tempted to ask Marvin about Dayton and whatever wedding he was talking about. I didn't. Instead, I said, "This letter's almost twenty-five years old."<br>"I know. I know. I just want you to find her. Tell me where she is, is all."<br>"Why?"<br>"Family business," he whispered as he rocked. "Important family business. All I can say about it. Family business is all I can say."<br>"Why now after all this time?" I asked.<br>"Somethin's come up. Family business. I don't want to talk about it. Please just find Vera Lynn. Let me talk to her, like just a minute. Converse."<br>"Fresh beer?" Billy called from the bar.<br>"No, thanks," I said.<br>"On me, Mr. Fonesca," Marvin said. "On me."<br>"You want privacy, Mr. F.," Billy said from behind the bar. "I've got a job out back Marvin can do, cleaning out the cabinets."<br>Marvin shook his head "no."<br>"No, thanks," I told Billy. "Marvin and I are old friends."<br>Actually, I had known Marvin for a couple of years, but we weren't friends. He did odd jobs in the three-block stretch of stores on 301 from Main Street to the Tamiami intersection, basically my neighborhood. Marvin washed windows, ran errands, swept up in exchange for food from the restaurants, an old pair of shoes or pants from a shoe or clothing store, a dollar from other businesses, and a place to sleep behind the sagging Angela's Tarot and Palm Reading shop down the street from where I worked and lived.<br>I was now engaged in the longest conversation I had ever had with my friend Marvin.<br>"I got a confession, Mr. Fonesca. I got drunk. Just a little. To get up the nerve to come find you. Then I was ashamed of being drunk so I sobered. So now my head is hurting fierce."<br>I gulped the last of my beer, patted Marvin on the shoulder, slid out of the booth, and got up.<br>"She's gone, Marvin," I said. "Get some sleep."<br>"I've got money," he said, digging into the pockets of his old denim jacket. Crumpled singles, fives, and tens appeared in his gnarled fists. He dropped them on top of the open album and kept digging into his pockets.<br>"See, I can pay."<br>Like a kid doing magic tricks Marvin continued to produce bills from his pants pockets, shirt pocket, the cuffs of his socks.<br>Lincoln and Washington looked up at me from the top of the heap of bills.<br>"We got a discrepancy there?" Billy called.<br>Marvin was hyperventilating now, his large eyes fixed on my face waiting for the answer to all his prayers.<br>"Almost all my life's savings," he said, his face pressing against an imaginary window of expected failure. "Just about all I've got. I'm not asking for favors here. Oh, no. I'm hiring you just like any other Joe. You too busy now? Okay, but I'm a...a..."<br>Marvin wasn't sure of what he was and I wasn't going to tell him.<br>"Billy," I called. "You have a paper bag?"<br>Billy looked over at the pile of bills.<br>"For that?"<br>"Yes."<br>"Paper or plastic?"<br>"Paper," I said.<br>Billy pulled a paper bag from under the bar, came around, and handed it to me. I shoved Marvin's money into it and handed Marvin the bag. He pushed it back at me.<br>"I'm saying 'please,'" Marvin said. He looked as if he were going to cry.<br>"Twenty dollars a day," I said with a sigh. "If I don't find Vera Lynn in five days, I give it up and you promise to give it up. Deal?"<br>Marvin went stone still.<br>"Give me forty in advance for two days," I said. "Most it can cost you is a hundred. I'll need the album and the letter."<br>He nodded and smiled.<br>"That's business," he said, holding out his hand. We shook and he dipped into the paper bag to pull out four tens. He handed them to me. "All's you got to do is find her, tell me where she is. I'll do the rest. It's important."<br>"I'm closing up for an early lunch, Mr. F.," called Billy, closing the newspaper. "Meeting some people at Longhorn. Place's like a morgue this morning anyway."<br>I assumed both Marvin and I were prime contributors to the funereal atmosphere.<br>I closed the album, tucked it under my arm, went to the bar, and handed Billy one of the four tens Marvin had put in my hand. Billy nodded and Marvin followed me into the street.<br>Traffic was moving slowly, but there was a lot of it. I wanted to cross the street, go to my room, and watch <i>The Shadow</i>, but I knew I'd be looking at Marvin Uliaks's album.<br>"Anything else you can tell me about her?" I asked.<br>"All in the book," he said, tapping the album. "All the answers I got. Like the Bible. Got the answers. You just have to figure out what they mean. I never could, not in the album, not in the Bible, not in any book pretty much even when I was a kid. But you know how to find me. Right now I'm going to Lupe's Resale to do some work unless you want me to come with you."<br>"Go to Lupe's," I said. "I'll find you if I need you."<br>He stood on the sidewalk while I waited for a break in traffic and jogged across the street, past the DQ, through the parking lot, and up the stairs to my office.

Isadora gifts her heroine, Lily, with a quintessential combination of dreams and determination, then allows us to sit in on the ballet class that Lili attends four times a week. Lili and fellow students model their dance wardrobes, demonstrate their exercises and steps, and imagine themselves dancing celebrated roles in a number of ballets. Each new element, be it a practice tutu, one of the five basic positions or a movement like a passe en pointe, receives its own illustration and is captioned in unornamented cursive script. Budding balletomanes will especially enjoy the detailed discussion of the ever-wondrous pointe shoe; another welcome section focuses on a class just for boys. Two depictions of full-scale ballet productions expand to fill entire spreads with dramatic color; as if to distinguish theatrical illusion from the arduous work behind the scenes, the rest of the book is rendered in pale washes. A former dancer whose daughter is enrolled at New York City's prestigious School of the American Ballet, Isadora presents ballet with familiarity and respect--she romanticizes neither the suffering nor the glory, and emphasizes only Lily's dedication.

An obsessive questioning back and forth builds up Blanchot&#39;s narrative, with its sense--shared with Kafka&#39;s famous doorkeeper parable--that behind each question lies the spooky possibility of a further, more imposing, more insoluble question. Thematically, powerlessness, inertia, insufficient speech, weariness, falling, faltering--everything tied to a negative or nonexistent value in ordinary discourse--is given value here by its being articulated, moved into writing and thought. What&#39;s insignificant or worthless gathers weight through its troubling persistence, its failure to disappear.

Reprint.</p><p>Anne McCaffrey is the author of the much loved Dragonriders of Pern series and lives in Ireland. Jody Lynn Nye is the author of Mythology 101, a series of humorous fantasies and lives in Chicago.YA-- Like Dan Davis in Heinlein's Door into Summer (Ballantine, 1986), Lunzie Mespil is a victim of cryogenic sleep and future shock. On three separate occasions following a deep-space disaster, she is placed in suspended animation totaling almost 90 years while awaiting rescue. Like Ripley in the film Aliens , she has lost not just her friends and loved ones, but everything familiar to her. Her story is a study of struggle against adversity as she tries to put her life back together. Because her medical knowledge is obsolete, Lunzie returns to school and becomes the medical officer on an exploratory vessel for the Federation of Sentient Planets. While routinely surveying the prehistoric life of the planet Ireta, she is caught in the middle of a violent racial mutiny. While not as strong a book as The Ship Who Sang (Ballantine, 1976) or most of the "Pern" novels, McCaffrey has created a feisty, likable character in Lunzie Mespil. This well-written yarn can stand alone, but it works best if read with Dinosaur Planet (1978), Dinosaur Planet Survivors (1984, both Ballantine), and Sassinak (Baen, 1990). --John Lawson, Fairfax County Public Library, VA<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Spy Who Loved: The Secrets and Lives of Christine Granville</h2><p><p><i>The Untold Story of Britain's First Female Special Agent of World War II</i></p><p>In June 1952, a woman was murdered by an obsessed colleague in a hotel in the South Kensington district of London. Her name was Christine Granville. That she died young was perhaps unsurprising; that she had survived the Second World War was remarkable.</p><p>The daughter of a feckless Polish aristocrat and his wealthy Jewish wife, Granville would become one of Britain's most daring and highly decorated special agents. Having fled to Britain on the outbreak of war, she was recruited by the intelligence services and took on mission after mission. She skied over the hazardous High Tatras into occupied Poland, served in Egypt and North Africa, and was later parachuted behind enemy lines into France, where an agent's life expectancy was only six weeks. Her courage, quick wit, and determination won her release from arrest more than once, and saved the lives of several fellow officers&#x2015;including one of her many lovers&#x2015;just hours before their execution by the Gestapo. More importantly, the intelligence she gathered in her espionage was a significant contribution to the Allied war effort, and she was awarded the George Medal, the OBE, and the Croix de Guerre.</p><p>Granville exercised a mesmeric power on those who knew her. In <i>The Spy Who Loved</i><i>,</i> acclaimed biographer Clare Mulley tells the extraordinary history of this charismatic, difficult, fearless, and altogether extraordinary woman.</p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, June 2013</strong>: Mere weeks after Germany&#x2019;s 1939 invasion of Poland, a woman the British Secret Services described as a "flaming Polish patriot, expert skier and great adventuress" had made her way back from South Africa to London with a brazen proposal: to ski into Poland from Hungary via the Carpathian Mountains. By the time Hitler's forces fell, Christine Granville had accomplished this and more extraordinary feats, delivering supplies, gathering vital intelligence, and defying expectations. She became Britain's first (and longest serving) female special agent, conducting undercover operations in two occupied countries and missions in numerous theaters of war, rescuing officers minutes before their execution and bringing hundreds of POWs back to the front lines. This story of how a charismatic Jewish Countess and beauty queen--raised to be a sedate society wife--parlayed her crackling vitality, flair for languages, and intrepid determination into action that directly undermined the Nazis makes for a sweepingly cinematic read. Churchill's favorite spy, one of the most decorated female intelligence agents of WWII, and one of her era's most liberated (and desired) women, Granville was driven by a passion for liberty "in love, in politics, and in life in the widest sense." Mulley has a sensitive, elegant, and wry way with Granville's story, informed by deep research into the scant published and complex unpublished material, and coupled with her own new interviews Christine's living friends and their children that vividly humanize her. And while her murder in 1952 at the hands of a jealous lover robbed her of the chance to fully realize her post-war promise, <em>The Spy Who Loved</em> is a marvelous tribute to her life and legacy. <em>--Mari Malcolm</em><p>CLARE MULLEY is the author of <i>The Woman Who Saved the Children</i>: A Biography of Eglantyne Jebb, which won the <i>Daily Mail </i>Biographers' Club Prize.

After the tragic attacks of September 11, 2001, he became a frequent government spokesman, helping to educate soldiers about Islam and build understanding throughout the military. Subsequently, Chaplain Yee was selected to serve as the Muslim Chaplain at Guantanamo Bay, where nearly 700 detainees captured in the war on terror were being held as "unlawful combatants." <p> In September 2003, after serving at Guantanamo for ten months in a role that gave him unrestricted access to the detainees--and after receiving numerous awards for his service there--Chaplain Yee was secretly arrested on his way to meet his wife and daughter for a routine two-week leave. He was locked away in a navy prison, subject to much of the same treatment that had been imposed on the Guantanamo detainees. Wrongfully accused of spying, and aiding the Taliban and Al Qaeda, Yee spent 76 excruciating days in solitary confinement and was threatened with the death penalty. </p><p> After the U.S. government determined it had made a grave mistake in its original allegations, it vindictively charged him with adultery and computer pornography. In the end all criminal charges were dropped and Chaplain Yee's record wiped clean. But his reputation was tarnished, and what has been a promising military career was left in ruins. </p><p> Depicting a journey of faith and service, Chaplain Yee's <i>For God and Country</i> is the story of a pioneering officer in the U.S. Army, who became a victim of the post-September 11 paranoia that gripped a starkly fearful nation. And it poses a fundamental question: If our country cannot be loyal to even the most patriotic Americans, can it remain loyal to itself?</p></p><p><b>James Yee</b>, a third-generation Chinese-American and a 1990 graduate of West Point, served in the U.S. Army for 14 years, including a tour in Saudi Arabia during the aftermath of the first Gulf War. His spiritual conversion to Islam in 1991 guided his travels to Damascus, Syria, where he studied for four years. He twice traveled to Mecca to make the Haj, the sacred Muslim pilgrimage.Wrongly accused of treason, imprisoned and later discharged, Muslim U.S. Army Chaplain James Yee served at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba-a detention center for War on Terror detainees-for most of 2003 before his Catch-22esque descent into a military inquiry fueled by suspicion of his faith, not evidence of his alleged wrongdoing. A graduate of West Point, Yee later converted to Islam and, upon his assignment to Guantanamo (Gitmo, to the locals), he became the base's third Muslim chaplain in six months, a contentious role that saw him educating soldiers that "Muslim" and "terrorist" were not synonymous, leading prayer services and ministering to detainees. He struck up friendships with the small group of Muslims working on the base, and, unbeknownst to him at the time, his group of friends had been dubbed "Hamas" by other Gitmo soldiers, an anecdote indicative of the accusations of treason that would soon hound him. Sincere almost to the point of na�vet�, Yee realizes the distorted view many Westerners have of Muslims, but is constantly surprised he would become a target. A searing indictment of justice gone awry and unchecked, systemic ignorance, Yee's story is sure to stimulate its share of discussion on a volatile subject at a crucial time.

Spanning Lincoln's life&#x2014;from his early career as a Springfield lawyer, to his presidential reign during one of America's most troubled historical periods, to his assassination in 1865&#x2014;these essays, developed from original C-SPAN interviews, provide a compelling, composite portrait of Lincoln, one that offers up new stories and fresh insights on a defining leader.<p>Edited by C-SPAN's Brian Lamb and Susan Swain, illustrated with Lamb's photographs of Lincoln landmarks, and promoted throughout the year on C-SPAN, <i>Abraham Lincoln</i> is a wonderful compendium of information and deeply-informed analysis that deserves a prominent place on every bookshelf.</p></p><p><b>Brian Lamb</b> is C-SPAN's chairman and CEO and longtime on-camera interviewer, noted for his just the facts&#x201d; style of interviewing. Many of the essays in this book are drawn from <i>Booknotes</i>, Lamb's long-running author-interview program, while others were conducted for C-SPAN's special history series on Lincoln and on the American presidency. Lamb lives in Arlington, Virginia.<p><b>Susan Swain</b> is President &amp; co-Chief Operating Officer of C-SPAN. For more than twenty-five years, she has been an on-air interviewer for the program. A regular moderator of <i>Washington Journal</i>, she's interviewed hundreds of members of Congress, policy experts, journalists, and several presidents. She lives in Northern Virginia.</p>There are about 16,000 books on Abraham Lincoln, and authors of about 50 of them (augmented by several non-Lincoln historians with opinions about the sixteenth U.S. president) appear in this edited compilation of C-SPAN interviews. Culled from the network&#x2019;s various book programs, they omit the questions put by host-editor Brian Lamb and his colleagues, but the relaxed directness that is his signature is detectable in the historians&#x2019; replies. Answers by anecdote abound, indicating Lamb perhaps asked &#x201c;Who was Ann Rutledge?&#x201d; or &#x201c;Was Lincoln a racist?&#x201d; in addition to covering every other curiosity the reading public has about Lincoln. That curiosity&nbsp;shows no signs of subsiding and every one of surging for the February 2009 bicentennial.&nbsp;This volume&#x2019;s review of the past&nbsp;15 years of Lincoln authorial effort demonstrates how interpretively vibrant the subject remains, still capable of producing original research&nbsp;such as&nbsp;Matthew Pinsker&#x2019;s Lincoln&#x2019;s Sanctuary (2003),&nbsp;despite or perhaps due to Lincoln&#x2019;s &#x201c;biographical inaccessibility,&#x201d; as Mark Neely comments. With content&nbsp;from history heavyweights David Herbert Donald, James McPherson, and Doris Kearns Goodwin, this&nbsp;will be in&nbsp;high demand for the bicentennial. --Gilbert Taylor</p><h2>Behind the Ranges: The Life-Changing Story of J.

What military and political leaders characterized as an impenetrable "Fortress Britannia"&#x2014;a bastion of solid opposition to the American cause&#x2014;was actually very different.</p><p>As Judith L. Van Buskirk reveals, the military standoff produced civilian communities that were forced to operate in close, sustained proximity, each testing the limits of political and military authority. Conflicting loyalties blurred relationships between the two sides: John Jay, a delegate to the Continental Congresses, had a brother whose political loyalties leaned toward the Crown, while one of the daughters of Continental Army general William Alexander lived in occupied New York City with her husband, a prominent Loyalist. Indeed, the texture of everyday life during the Revolution was much more complex than historians have recognized.</p><p><i>Generous Enemies</i> challenges many long-held assumptions about wartime experience during the American Revolution by demonstrating that communities conventionally depicted as hostile opponents were, in fact, in frequent contact. Living in two clearly delineated zones of military occupation&#x2014;the British occupying the islands of New York Bay and the Americans in the surrounding countryside&#x2014;the people of the New York City region often reached across military lines to help friends and family members, pay social calls, conduct business, or pursue a better life. Examining the movement of Loyalist and rebel families, British and American soldiers, free blacks, slaves, and businessmen, Van Buskirk shows how personal concerns often triumphed over political ideology.</p><p>Making use of family letters, diaries, memoirs, soldier pensions, Loyalist claims, committee and church records, and newspapers, this compelling social history tells the story of the American Revolution with a richness of human detail.</p></p><p>Judith L. Van Buskirk teaches history at the State University of New York, Cortland.<p>"Well-written and engaging."&#x2014;<i>Choice</i></p><br><br><p>"A nicely written and well argued volume. . . .

But instead of finding tales of bloodshed and betrayal, she finds that family bonds trumped partisan causes, personal concerns triumphed over political ideology, and commercial interests overrode military strategy. The lines between contending forces were porous, and the texture of everyday life in the city was much more complicated, she writes, than historians, and the public alike, have admitted."&#x2014;<i>Journal of American Studies</i></p></p><h2>Life on a Young Planet: The First Three Billion Years of Evolution on Earth</h2><p><p>Australopithecines, dinosaurs, trilobites--such fossils conjure up images of lost worlds filled with vanished organisms. But in the full history of life, ancient animals, even the trilobites, form only the half-billion-year tip of a nearly four-billion-year iceberg. Andrew Knoll explores the deep history of life from its origins on a young planet to the incredible Cambrian explosion, presenting a compelling new explanation for the emergence of biological novelty.</p><br><p> The very latest discoveries in paleontology--many of them made by the author and his students--are integrated with emerging insights from molecular biology and earth system science to forge a broad understanding of how the biological diversity that surrounds us came to be. Moving from Siberia to Namibia to the Bahamas, Knoll shows how life and environment have evolved together through Earth's history. Innovations in biology have helped shape our air and oceans, and, just as surely, environmental change has influenced the course of evolution, repeatedly closing off opportunities for some species while opening avenues for others.</p><br><p> Readers go into the field to confront fossils, enter the lab to discern the inner workings of cells, and alight on Mars to ask how our terrestrial experience can guide exploration for life beyond our planet. Along the way, Knoll brings us up-to-date on some of science's hottest questions, from the oldest fossils and claims of life beyond the Earth to the hypothesis of global glaciation and Knoll's own unifying concept of ''permissive ecology.''</p><br><p> In laying bare Earth's deepest biological roots, <i>Life on a Young Planet</i> helps us understand our own place in the universe--and our responsibility as stewards of a world four billion years in the making.</p></p><p>Winner of 2003 Phi Beta Kappa Book Award in Science<br><p>"Andrew Knoll, one of the world's foremost paleontologists, here presents the origin and early evolution of life the way it should be told: a mystery unfolding as an epic.

Wilson, Harvard University</b><br></p><br><p>"Here is a firsthand account of one of the most exciting quests in modern science. Knoll writes with the confidence of a distinguished scientist who has devoted his career to unraveling the mysteries of life's origins and the passion of someone who deeply believes in the importance of recent discoveries about life before the Cambrian explosion. From the wilds of Siberia to the ocean floor, from Earth to Mars and beyond, he takes readers on a fascinating personal adventure that may change the way they think about themselves and their place in the world."<b>--Lawrence M.

Each character becomes a vivid part of the listener's imagination. In THE RELATIVES CAME, the annual summer trip is fondly remembered. Similar car trips, greetings, spreads of food and conversation, and bulging houses will spring to mind. The relaxed pace of this recording provides the time to savor these memories. In PICKLES TO PITTSBURGH, Judi Barrett revisits the wonderful world of Chewandswallow, featuring immense foodstuffs, and from this world distinct characters emerge. Listeners will appreciate the interplay of Grandpa's adventure with Kate's dream and the relationships of the fantastic foods. In PETE'S A PIZZA, Pete is in a terrible state, and it is his father who has the wisdom to humor him back to his usual self by making Pete into a pizza pie. The giggles of Pete and the listeners increase as Pete is kneaded, stretched, spread, baked, and (almost) sliced. Food is also center stage in CHATO'S KITCHEN. In hospitable fashion, Chato invites his new neighbors to dinner. Dreaming of a mouse feast, Chato and his cat buddy think up and stir up a delicious meal with Spanish flavor, only to be greeted at the door by the mice and their special guest. The twist in the anticipated outcome and the deep richness of Chato's voice are memorable. While special treats baked for school are a part of the story, it is the interaction of Lilly with her teacher that is central and poignant in LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE. Their days have ups and downs in typical childlike mode as only Kevin Henkes can portray. Will Lilly weather the humiliation when Mr. Slinger takes (just for the day) her prized new possession? In this recording Lilly is enjoyably squeaky, and Mr. Slinger is kindly authoritative and wise. Background voices are used effectively to interject the "bubble stories" from the text. While listening to this collection of stories is a distinct pleasure, the illustrations help to make the experience memorable. Listen, look, and enjoy!

Jacqueline Jones shows unmistakably how nearly every significant social transformation in American history (from bound to free labor, from farm work to factory work, from a blue-collar to a white-collar economy) rolled back the hard-won advances of those African Americans who had managed to gain footholds in various jobs and industries. This is a story not of simple ideological "racism" but of politics and economics interacting to determine what kind of work was "suitable" for which groups. Here is a "useful and sobering" (Kirkus Reviews) account of why the connection between success and the work ethic was severed long ago for a substantial number of Americans. American Work goes far beyond the easy sloganeering of the current debates on affirmative action and welfare versus workfare to inform those debates with rich historical context and compelling insight.</p><p>Jacqueline Jones is also the author of Labor of Love, Labor of Sorrow: Black Women, Work, and the Family from Slavery to the Present (winner of the Bancroft Prize in American History; a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize). She chairs the history department at Brandeis University.A well-researched but unbalanced study of the interelation of race and labor in American history. Bancroft Prizewinning historian Jones (Brandeis Univ.; The Dispossesed, 1992; Labor of Love, Labor of Sorrow, 1985) sets out to explore how and why black and white workers have been treated differently throughout American history, both before and after emancipation. Her study begins with a look at the failed policy of enslaving Indians and the subsequent practice of importing African slaves. Some black slaves in the South won or bought their freedom, but most free blacks found themselves either with few prospects as far as skilled labor was concerned or compelled to work for the same people to whom they had been enslaved. Meanwhile, in the mostly ``free'' North, job competition between free blacks and whites often exploded in violence; immigrants from Ireland and elsewhere would destroy black property and assault African-Americans who they felt were vying for their jobs. This is one of the primary paradoxes that Jones addresses: White Americans in the 19th and 20th centuries could simultaneously view blacks as intellectually and functionally inferior and yet fear that these perceived inferiors could take their jobs. The truth, of course, is that prejudicial hiring practices kept this from happening, even after the passing of civil rights legislation in the 20th century. Unions, while giving lip service to brotherhood and equality, were likewise discriminatory toward racial minorities. Disappointingly, Jones devotes much of the book to the period from early settlements up to the Civil War. The discussion of work-related discrimination in the 20th century, by contrast, seems too terse and insufficiently detailed. For instance, the fate of the laws meant to enforce equal opportunity and affirmative action doesn't get the close attention that it requires. In the end, the subject is probably too large for one volume. Nonetheless, this is a useful and sobering work. (34 b&amp;w photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Discover how each animal came to make the noise it does today in this whimsical retelling of the beloved Noah&#39;s ark story.</p><p>Rog� is a fine observer of the everyday life. He is largely inspired by urban scenes, passers-by and the many people who surround him in the caf�s where he enjoys working on his sketches. He has a gift for making the past bounce into the present, for having comedy burst out of tragedy and for making the light flash in the darkness. He has a sensitive and intelligent look on life and shares his vision with delight. <br><br>Born and raised in Quebec, Rog� studied graphic design at Laval University. He began his career working as an art director for well-established advertising agencies.

In the course of a three-month stay in the Dominican Republic, he painted large murals in a village and the experience gave him a new sense of direction. Upon his return, he settled in Montreal and decided to take on illustration full-time."Krensky uses the basic elements of the Noah's Ark story for his own original pourquoi tale of how the animals came to have their own distinctive sounds. While Noah builds his ark in preparation for the imminent flood, he is surrounded by a wide assortment of animals that randomly use all the typical animal sounds from moos to meows. Though Noah successfully herds all the animal pairs into the ark, chaos ensues, and there is no communication between species until Noah devises a way for the animals to choose their own characteristic noises. <strong>The amusing, understated text has the flavor of a traditional folktale, well complemented by Rog�&#x2019;s na�ve paintings with flattened perspective and muted colors. The illustrations have a dark, moody atmosphere with gray skies and driving rain, offset by the folksy charm of the animals.</strong> There is no obvious religious content in the text, with no mention of God and no dove or rainbow. While this choice makes the book plenty ecumenical, it also will render readers unfamiliar with the story mystified at Noah's foreknowledge of the flood and determination to build the ark."<br>--<em>Kirkus Reviews</em> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br>"<b>There are a lot of Bible-themed picture books out there, but few will be as popular as this humorous offering.</b> It is long ago, and the world is full of confusing sounds made by silly animals: beavers crow, snakes quack, pigs howl, and elephants hiss. Annoyed at the noise, Noah barks at them to keep quiet while he builds an ark, but they ignore him - until the rains begin. In the ship's lower deck, the animals crowd together, trying to keep their pointy parts to themselves. To stifle their chaotic cacophony, Noah borrows a turkey feather, writes a list of all the animal sounds, cuts the list into pieces, and puts the scraps into a kangaroo's pouch. Thanks to Noah's bark (bigger, in fact, than his bite), the animals get to randomly choose their new, and permanent, sounds, restoring sanity and safety. <b>The stylized, brushstroked paintings are embellished with highlighted sound effects and subtle comic expressions. Inventive and sure to elicit a boatload of giggles.</b>" <br>--<i>Booklist</i> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br>"Krensky retells the story of Noah's ark as a pourquoi tale to explain why each animal makes its own special sound.

For the short time of its existence, it was the biggest building on Earth.

It was a miracle that it was built at all. Less than a year earlier it had not even existed as an idea. The exhibition for which it was conceived was the dream of a civil servant named Henry Cole, whose other principal claim to history&#x2019;s attention is as the inventor of the Christmas card (as a way of encouraging people to use the new penny post). In 1849, Cole visited the Paris Exhibition&#x2014; a comparatively parochial affair, limited to French manufacturers&#x2014; and became keen to try something similar in England, but grander. He persuaded many worthies, including Prince Albert, to get excited about the idea of a great exhibition, and on January 11, 1850, they held their first meeting with a view to opening on May 1 of the following year. This gave them slightly less than fifteen months to design and erect the largest building ever envisioned, attract and install tens of thousands of displays from every quarter of the globe, fit out restaurants and restrooms, employ staff, arrange insurance and police protection, print up handbills, and do a million other things, in a country that wasn&#x2019;t at all convinced it wanted such a costly and disruptive production in the first place. It was a patently unachievable ambition, and for the next several months they patently failed to achieve it. In an open competition, 245 designs for the exhibition hall were submitted. All were rejected as unworkable.<br>&nbsp;<br>Facing disaster, the committee did what committees in desperate circumstances sometimes do: it commissioned another committee with a better title. The Building Committee of the Royal Commission for the Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations consisted of four men&#x2014; Matthew Digby Wyatt, Owen Jones, Charles Wild, and the great engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel&#x2014; and a single instruction, to come up with a design worthy of the greatest exhibition in history, to begin in ten months, within a constrained and shrunken budget. Of the four committee members, only the youthful Wyatt was a trained architect, and he had not yet actually built anything; at this stage of his career he made his living as a writer. Wild was an engineer whose experience was almost exclusively with boats and bridges. Jones was an interior decorator. Only Brunel had experience with large-scale projects. He was indubitably a genius but an unnerving one, as it nearly always took epic infusions of time and cash to find a point of intersection between his soaring visions and an achievable reality.<br>&nbsp;<br>The structure the four men came up with now was a thing of unhappy wonder. A vast, low, dark shed of a building, pregnant with gloom, with all the spirit and playfulness of an abattoir, it looked like something designed in a hurry by four people working separately. The cost could scarcely be calculated, but it was almost certainly unbuildable anyway. Construction would require thirty million bricks, and there was no guarantee that such a number could be acquired, much less laid, in time. The whole was to be capped off by Brunel&#x2019;s contribution: an iron dome two hundred feet across&#x2014; a striking feature, without question, but rather an odd one on a one-story building. No one had ever built such a massive thing of iron before, and Brunel couldn&#x2019;t of course begin to tinker and hoist until there was a building beneath it&#x2014; and all of this to be undertaken and completed in ten months, for a project intended to stand for less than half a year. Who would take it all down afterward and what would become of its mighty dome and millions of bricks were questions too uncomfortable to consider.<br>&nbsp;<br>Into this unfolding crisis stepped the calm figure of Joseph Paxton, head gardener of Chatsworth House, principal seat of the Duke of Devonshire (but located in that peculiar English way in Derbyshire). Paxton was a wonder. Born into a poor farming family in Bedfordshire in 1803, he was sent out to work as an apprentice gardener at the age of fourteen; he so distinguished himself that within six years he was running an experimental arboretum at the new and prestigious Horticultural Society (soon to become the Royal Horticultural Society) in West London&#x2014; a startlingly responsible job for someone who was really still just a boy. There one day he fell into conversation with the Duke of Devonshire, who owned neighboring Chiswick House and rather a lot of the rest of the British Isles&#x2014; some two hundred thousand acres of productive countryside spread beneath seven great stately homes. The duke took an instant shine to Paxton, not so much, it appears, because Paxton showed any particular genius as because he spoke in a strong, clear voice. The duke was hard of hearing and appreciated clarity of speech. Impulsively, he invited Paxton to be head gardener at Chatsworth. Paxton accepted. He was twenty-two years old.<br>&nbsp;<br>It was the most improbably wise move any aristocrat has ever made. Paxton leaped into the job with levels of energy and application that simply dazzled. He designed and installed the famous Emperor Fountain, which could send a jet of water 290 feet into the air&#x2014; a feat of hydraulic engineering that has since been exceeded only once in Europe; built the largest rockery in the country; designed a new estate village; became the world&#x2019;s leading expert on the dahlia; won prizes for producing the country&#x2019;s finest melons, figs, peaches, and nectarines; and created an enormous tropical hothouse, known as the Great Stove, which covered an acre of ground and was so roomy within that Queen Victoria, on a visit in 1843, was able to tour it in a horse-drawn carriage. Through improved estate management, Paxton eliminated �1 million from the duke&#x2019;s debts. With the duke&#x2019;s blessing, he launched and ran two gardening magazines and a national daily newspaper, the <i>Daily News</i>, which was briefly edited by Charles Dickens. He wrote books on gardening, invested so wisely in the shares of railway companies that he was invited onto the boards of three of them, and at Birkenhead, near Liverpool, designed and built the world&#x2019;s first municipal park. This park so captivated the American landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted that he modeled Central Park in New York on it. In 1849, the head botanist at Kew sent Paxton a rare and ailing lily, wondering if he could save it. Paxton designed a special hothouse and&#x2014; you won&#x2019;t be surprised to hear&#x2014; within three months had the lily flowering.<br>&nbsp;<br>When he learned that the commissioners of the Great Exhibition were struggling to find a design for their hall, it occurred to him that something like his hothouses might work. While chairing a meeting of a committee of the Midland Railway, he doodled a rough design on a piece of blotting paper and had completed drawings ready for review in two weeks. The design actually broke all the competition rules. It was submitted after the closing date and, for all its glass and iron, it incorporated many combustible materials&#x2014; acres of wooden flooring, for one thing&#x2014; which were strictly forbidden. The architectural consultants pointed out, not unreasonably, that Paxton was not a trained architect and had never attempted anything on this scale before. But then, of course, no one had. For that reason, nobody could declare with complete confidence that the scheme would work. Many worried that the building would grow insupportably warm when filled with baking sunshine and jostling crowds. Others feared that the lofty glazing bars would expand in the summer&#x2019;s heat and that giant panes of glass would silently fall out and crash onto the throngs below. The profoundest worry was that the whole frail-looking edifice would simply blow away in a storm.<br>&nbsp;<br>So the risks were considerable and keenly felt, yet after only a few days of fretful hesitation the commissioners approved Paxton&#x2019;s plan. Nothing&#x2014; really, absolutely nothing&#x2014; says more about Victorian Britain and its capacity for brilliance than that the century&#x2019;s most daring and iconic building was entrusted to a gardener. Paxton&#x2019;s Crystal Palace required no bricks at all&#x2014; indeed, no mortar, no cement, no foundations. It was just bolted together and sat on the ground like a tent. This was not merely an ingenious solution to a monumental challenge but also a radical departure from anything that had ever been tried before.<br>&nbsp;<br>The central virtue of Paxton&#x2019;s airy palace was that it could be prefabricated from standard parts. At its heart was a single component&#x2014; a cast-iron truss three feet wide and twenty-three feet, three inches long&#x2014;which could be fitted together with matching trusses to make a frame on which to hang the building&#x2019;s glass&#x2014; nearly a million square feet of it, or a third of all the glass normally produced in Britain in a year. A special mobile platform was designed that moved along the roof supports, enabling workmen to install eighteen thousand panes of glass a week&#x2014; a rate of productivity that was, and is, a wonder of efficiency. To deal with the enormous amount of guttering required&#x2014; some twenty miles in all&#x2014; Paxton designed a machine, manned by a small team, that could attach two thousand feet of guttering a day&#x2014; a quantity that would previously have represented a day&#x2019;s work for three hundred men. In every sense the project was a marvel.<br>&nbsp;<br>Paxton was very lucky in his timing, for just at the moment of the Great Exhibition glass suddenly became available in a way it never had before. Glass had always been a tricky material. It was not particularly easy to make, and really hard to make well, which is why for so much of its history it was a luxury item. Happily, two recent technological breakthroughs had changed that. First, the French invented plate glass&#x2014; so called because the molten glass was spread across tables known as plates. This allowed for the first time the creation of really large panes of glass, which made shop windows possible. Plate glass, however, had to be cooled for ten days after being rolled out, which meant that each table was unproductively occupied most of the time, and then each sheet required a lot of grinding and polishing. This naturally made it expensive. In 1838, a cheaper refinement was developed&#x2014; sheet glass. This had most of the virtues of plate glass, but it cooled faster and needed less polishing, and so could be made much more cheaply. Suddenly glass of a good size could be produced economically in limitless volumes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Allied with this was the timely abolition of two long-standing taxes: the window tax and glass tax (which, strictly speaking, was an excise duty). The window tax dated from 1696 and was sufficiently punishing that people really did avoid putting windows in buildings where they could. The bricked-up window openings that are such a feature of many period buildings in Britain today were once usually painted to look like windows. (It is sometimes rather a shame that they aren&#x2019;t still.) The tax, sorely resented as &#x201c;a tax on air and light,&#x201d; meant that many servants and others of constrained means were condemned to live in airless rooms.<br>&nbsp;<br>The second duty, introduced in 1746, was based not on the number of windows but on the weight of the glass within them, so glass was made thin and weak throughout the Georgian period, and window frames had to be compensatingly sturdy. The well-known bull&#x2019;s-eye panes also became a feature at this time. They are a consequence of the type of glassmaking that produced what was known as crown glass (so called because it is slightly convex, or crown-shaped). The bull&#x2019;s-eye marked the place on a sheet of glass where the blower&#x2019;s pontil&#x2014; the blowing tool&#x2014; had been attached. Because that part of the glass was flawed, it escaped the tax and so developed a certain appeal among the frugal. Bull&#x2019;s-eye panes became popular in cheap inns and businesses, and at the backs of private homes where quality was not an issue. The glass levy was abolished in 1845, just shy of its hundredth anniversary, and the abolition of the window tax followed, conveniently and fortuitously, in 1851. Just at the moment when Paxton wanted more glass than anyone ever had before, the price was reduced by more than half. This, along with the technological changes that independently boosted production, made the Crystal Palace possible.<br>&nbsp;<br>The finished building was precisely 1,851 feet long (in celebration of the year), 408 feet across, and almost 110 feet high along its central spine&#x2014; spacious enough to enclose a much admired avenue of elms that would otherwise have had to be felled. Because of its size, the structure required a lot of inputs&#x2014;293,655 panes of glass, 33,000 iron trusses, and tens of thousands of feet of wooden flooring&#x2014; yet thanks to Paxton&#x2019;s methods, the final cost came in at an exceedingly agreeable �80,000. From start to finish, the work took just under thirty-five weeks. St. Paul&#x2019;s Cathedral had taken thirty-five years.<br>&nbsp;<br>Two miles away the new Houses of Parliament had been under construction for a decade and still weren&#x2019;t anywhere near complete. A writer for <i>Punch </i>suggested, only half in jest, that the government should commission Paxton to design a Crystal Parliament. A catchphrase arose for any problem that proved intractable: &#x201c;Ask Paxton.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The Crystal Palace was at once the world&#x2019;s largest building and its lightest, most ethereal one. Today we are used to encountering glass in volume, but to someone living in 1851 the idea of strolling through cubic acres of airy light <i>inside </i>a building was dazzling&#x2014; indeed, giddying. The arriving visitor&#x2019;s first sight of the Exhibition Hall from afar, glinting and transparent, is really beyond our imagining. It would have seemed as delicate and evanescent, as miraculously improbable, as a soap bubble. To anyone arriving at Hyde Park, the first sight of the Crystal Palace, floating above the trees, sparkling in sunshine, would have been a moment of knee-weakening splendor.<br>&nbsp;<br>II<br>As the Crystal Palace rose in London, 110 miles to the northeast, beside an ancient country church under the spreading skies of Norfolk, a rather more modest edifice went up in 1851 in a village near the market town of Wymondham: a parsonage of a vague and rambling nature, beneath an irregular rooftop of barge-boarded gables and jaunty chimney stacks in a cautiously Gothic style&#x2014;&#x201c;a good-sized house, and comfortable enough in a steady, ugly, respectable way,&#x201d; as Margaret Oliphant, a hugely popular and prolific Victorian novelist, described the breed in her novel <i>The Curate in Charge.</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>This is the building to which we shall be attached over the next 440 or ...</p><h2>Weddings and Movie Stars</h2><p>Movie star weddings run the gamut from studio cover-ups to Hollywood endings but whether your taste is for the explosive or the fairy tale, <i>Weddings and Movie Stars</i> will quench your thirst for impeccable glamour and salacious gossip.

He attended the Jesuit College at Darjeeling and St Edmund&#39;s School, Canterbury. His first literary work, The Black Book, appeared in Paris in 1938. His first collection of poems, A Private Country, was published in 1943, followed by the three Island books: Prospero&#39;s Cell, Reflections on a Marine Venus, about Rhodes, and Bitter Lemons, his account of life in Cyprus. Durrell&#39;s wartime sojourn in Egypt led to his masterpiece, The Alexandria Quartet, which he completed in southern France where he settled permanently in 1957. Between the Quartet and The Avignon Quintet he wrote the two-decker Tunc and Nunquam. His oeuvre includes plays, a book of criticism, translations, travel writing, and humorous stories about the diplomatic corps. Caesar&#39;s Vast Ghost, his reflections on the history and culture of Provence, including a late flowering of poems, appeared a few days before his death in Sommieres in 1990.The noted novelist's sixth travel book explores the history and culture of Provence, where he has lived for more than three decades. Although not quite on the same level as Bitter Lemons (Dutton, 1959), which focused on the political tensions over Cyprus in the 1950s, Vast Ghost has all the characteristics of Durrell's travel books: brilliant descriptive passages, esoteric theories on love and culture, colorful local characters, and bizarre sexual escapades. (The book concludes with the author escorting a "Latex doll of great beauty" to a water party on the Rhone.) Durrell won't win over any converts, but those who enjoyed his previous travel writings won't be disappointed either.<br><i>- Donald P.

Sometimes a teacher offered to teach in a village, and then the villagers decided to build the school. The first teachers were usually men. Some teachers wandered from place to place and taught at a new school each year. Others became members of a community. When a teacher was hired, he usually boarded with families in the area. He lived with one family for a few months and then on to the next house. The teacher&#39;s job included more than teaching. He might visit the sick and read to the blind.

Using writers from Alexandria (Clement, Origen, and Athanasius) and North Africa (Tertullian, Cyprian and Augustine) as test cases, Howard-Brook traces how Platonic and Stoic philosophy on the one hand, and Roman imperial culture, on the other, were taken for granted by these writers in creating"Christianity."&nbsp;Using a wide range of recent scholarship, Howard-Brook seeks in this book to separate the anti-imperial, earthly and earthy "Good News" of Jesus from the imperial, anti-creation, misogynist and anti-Jewish "Christianity" that has largely replaced the Gospel.</p><p><b>Wes Howard-Brook</b> teaches at Seattle University. He is the author of several Orbis books, including <i>"Come Out, My People," Unveiling Empire, The Church Before Christianity, Becoming Children of God,</i> and co-editor of <i>The New Testament: Introducing the Way of Discipleship.</i> He and his wife, Sue Ferguson Johnson, collaborate in the ministry, Abide in Me, which seeks to lead people and communities into deeper integration of the inner and outer paths that empowers people to "come out" of empire.Wes Howard-Brook has performed a great service with Empire Baptized. He explains how the transition in Christianity from Jesus&#39;s way of peace to the coercive ways of Christendom happened.

She lives with her husband and two sons in Rye, New York.<b>Romantic Elegance</b><br><br><i>Reflective Travels</i><br><br>Interior designer Karen Houghton and her husband, Michael, who is a dealer in rare and out-of-print books, are very much a part of the fabric of Nyack, New York. This small town on the Hudson River, an hour outside of New York City, is home to many well-known members of the art and theater worlds. The Houghtons' Second Empire Victorian house, built around 1850, is located in downtown Nyack, a favorite weekend haunt for antique and collectibles aficionados.<br><br>Karen Houghton's passion for antiques began when, as a child, she would tag along on treasure hunts with her parents, who were antique dealers in Nyack in the 1960s. As she explains, "Finding an object that spoke to me, striking the deal, cleaning and mending it, looking it up in my reference books, and trying to evaluate its market value--this is the process I learned from my parents and still follow today. I love to collect, but now I spend more time helping my clients develop their own collecting passions. At this point, my house is nearly full."<br><br>Houghton finds many pieces on the shopping trips she takes to Europe at least twice a year. "I have my lucky haunts in London and in the States that I return to regularly, but it is such fun to venture down some unknown road and discover something delightful!" Her own master bedroom is the perfect home for some of her many unique finds.<br><br>The couple's timelessly serene bedroom is filled with a mixture of these pieces along with those she inherited from her parents. The room includes an alcove, and she notes, "Since our bedroom is an odd shape, I placed the sofa on an angle. This rounds out the corner and allows the eye to travel across the room."<br><br>The alcove, original to the room, is the ideal spot for the bed. Karen has deliberately kept to a warm, earthy palette with touches of gilt throughout the space. The bed itself is crowned with a gilt ciel de lit. And at the foot of the bed, stacked atop one another, are a papered box, a gout stool, an antique tooled metal-and-wood document box, and a nineteenth-century Anglo-Indian camphor-wood box.<br><br>Says Houghton, "My boxes and baskets offer perfect storage for many of my collections. They are wonderful in themselves, and they can often be found for reasonable prices at flea markets and antique stores."<br><br>Opposite the bed alcove is a niche that holds more baskets and boxes. These are filled with antique French and American quilts. A nineteenth-century dressing table with crystal knobs and its original Carrara marble top is the perfect setting for another collection--Karen's vintage perfume bottles. The vanity is a rarity, she says, because she found it in its original condition without pieces missing. A strictly feminine touch is added by the prints above the vanity. The prints are from an eighteenth-century Parisan cosmetics catalog, and three more reflect one of her most recent passions--portraits of nineteenth-century women.<br><br>The enthusiasms of Houghton's husband are also reflected in this room. "Being the wife of a bookseller has its consequences," she says. "Almost all of the rooms and even our hallways contain books and bookshelves, so naturally we added a niche beside the bed to hold some of our many books as well."<br><br>Besides being the perfect place to settle in with a good read, the Houghtons' bedroom is a stylish nod to both of its occupants. "I can walk in to this room again and again and not get tired of it," Houghton muses. "It feels good to wake up here."<br><br><b>Manhattan Romance</b><br>Barrie Vanderpoel is a principal at Vanderpoel Schneider Group, an interior design firm. Vanderpoel, who lives in Manhattan with her husband, Wynant, has completed numerous bedroom projects for her clients, but her bedroom is very much her own, reflecting her love of beautiful textiles, antiques, and those objects that personalize a room, like good books, family photographs, and momentos.<br><br>A canopied bed, circa 1785, draped in a white fabric by Lee Jofa, is the focal point of the room. "I really love eighteenth-century furniture," she says. "Things that have been considered beautiful for three hundred years usually turn out to be pretty good choices."<br><br>Vanderpoel has chosen pristine white sheets from Monica Noel that have a tailored trim of green. At the foot of the bed, an upholstered custom-made bench by Lewis Mittman is covered in the Old World Weavers fabric "Piona," which is also used to upholster the walls and drape the windows. She has given definition to the room by outlining the arches, doors, and some of the furniture with deep green grosgrain ribbon, which she simply glued on.<br><br>On her husband's side of the bed, on a small eighteenth-century wooden table, Vanderpoel has amassed a still life of necessities: a telephone, an orchid, and some framed photographs. She stores her magazines and newspapers underneath the table in two baskets. Vanderpoel notes, "I keep using these baskets because the proportions are so good."<br><br>At her bedside is a skirted glass-top circular table topped with a Steuben bird the Vanderpoels received as a wedding gift, along with two favorite family photographs and, always, a vase of fresh white roses.<br><br>At the top of Wynant's wish list for the bedroom was a large-screen television set easily visible from the bed. Barrie chose an armoire that she says, is "like great classic architecture."<br><br>Vanderpoel also added a piece that she feels, "adds a softness, a femininity, to the room." This is a dressing table that she designed and skirted. The lamps atop the dressing table are nineteenth-century English porcelain candlesticks she had wired, and the mirror is a reproduction Chippendale that Barrie found and whose frame she painted white. "I like elaborate pieces painted white to be more informal," she explains.<br><br>One piece that the designer created for herself over a decade ago and that she keeps re-creating for her clients is her floral-painted screen. "It's good for concealing things," she says. She puts hers to good use in front of a file cabinet full of materials for "late-night inspiration."<br><br>Throughout the room are carefully placed personal objects that are important to the Vanderpoels. Observes Barrie Vanderpoel, "I love anything that makes a room more personal. A room is a living thing. If you can't put your feet up on a table and display your favorite photos and prints and books, it has no life."</p><h2>The Wholeness of Life</h2><p>The discord that has marked human existence, perception of the condition of the psyche, and truth are considered in Krishnamurti&#39;s discussion with a physicist and a psychiatrist, in his 1977 public talks delivered in America and Europe, and in his intimate talks with an international group in California</p><p>This series of discussions held by Krishnamurti with physicist David Bohm and with psychiatrist David Shainbert explores how fragmentation of the mind has resulted in division, fear, and conflict.</p><h2>Advice and Consent: Clarence Thomas, Robert Bork and the Intriguing History of the Supreme Court&#39;s Nomination Battles</h2><p>An insider&#39;s view of the Supreme Court appointment process chronicles the Senate&#39;s role in confirmation proceedings since the George Washington administration, suggesting that the president discuss potential nominees with the Senate before submitting his final choice.</p><p>Senator Simon (D.-Ill.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, gives an insider's account of the confirmation process for Supreme Court nominees. He examines recent controversial confirmation hearings, especially for Clarence Thomas and Robert Bork, and earlier confirmation battles beginning with George Washington's administration. Simon offers new information and a distinctive perspective on the Thomas hearings and the Thomas-Hill confrontation. Arguing that the Senate should take its "advice and consent" responsibilities seriously, he recommends that the Senate should insure ideological diversity among Supreme Court nominees, inquire closely into the nominee's substantive views, and use executive sessions when nominees face serious charges. He also suggests that presidents should seriously seek the advice and consent of the Senate prior to nominating a justice. This thoughtful analysis is recommended for legal and political collections.

Other climbs include lightweight attempts of the west ridge of Everest in winter, the northwest ridge of K2, the east face of Sepu Kangri, first ascents of Chong Kundam I and V in the Eastern Karakoram, and many other notable climbs around the world over a period of 55 years.

The author portrays them as the most accomplished travelling and adventuring couple of the 20th century. Miles Smeeton has written nine books including &#34;Once is Enough&#34;, &#34;Because the Horn Was There&#34;, and &#34;The Sea Was Our Village&#34;, which earned him the reputation of adventurer, sailor, conservationist and storyteller. As a young army officer in 1934, he fell in love with the Commanding Officer&#39;s wife - Beryl Boxer - during a 6000-mile overland journey from India to England. At that stage she had already travelled alone across four continents on foot and horseback.

In her beautifully nostalgic memoirs, she recalls in rich detail the three houses in which she grew up and the childhood memories their walls contain. Thirkell&#x2019;s elaborate portraits of the three houses &#x2013; The Grange in Fulham, 27 Young Street in Kensington Square, and North End House in Rottingdean - offer an invaluable insight into late Victorian life. Her recounting of forbidden explorations, Punch and Judy shows, and adventures in the garden are beautifully evocative of the innocent quality of childhood, and the personal recollections of her famous grandfather present a loving family man behind the renown. The exposure to music, art and literature that Thirkell details in her exploration of her beloved three houses foreshadows her later fictional creations &#x2013; her Barsetshire novels. Three Houses allows us a snapshot of history from the busy literary centre of London to the English coast.

Alice Howland has a career not unlike Genova&#39;s-she&#39;s an esteemed psychology professor at Harvard, living a comfortable life in Cambridge with her husband, John, arguing about the usual (making quality time together, their daughter&#39;s move to L.A.) when the first symptoms of Alzheimer&#39;s begin to emerge. First, Alice can&#39;t find her Blackberry, then she becomes hopelessly disoriented in her own town. Alice is shocked to be diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer&#39;s (she had suspected a brain tumor or menopause), after which her life begins steadily to unravel. She loses track of rooms in her home, resigns from Harvard and eventually cannot recognize her own children. The brutal facts of Alzheimer&#39;s are heartbreaking, and it&#39;s impossible not to feel for Alice and her loved ones, but Genova&#39;s prose style is clumsy and her dialogue heavy-handed. This novel will appeal to those dealing with the disease and may prove helpful, but beyond the heartbreaking record of illness there&#39;s little here to remember.

If you simply think beyond the link, you&#x2019;ll find a whole world of sausage possibilities. Patties, meatballs, fish balls, veg balls, meat loaf&#x2014;these are all sausages without casings that are every bit as savory and satisfying as their linked cousins. And, since they do not require special equipment, they are a snap to make at home.<br>&nbsp;<br>In <i>Sausage</i>, Victoria Wise shares more than 75 recipes for easy-to-make, no-casing-required pork, beef, lamb, poultry, seafood, and even vegetarian sausages, including innovative recipes that turn them into sophisticated meals. An inviting and wonderfully diverse collection from all around the globe, this compendium features European classics, American mainstays, Asian favorites, Middle Eastern inspirations, and sausages African in origin. You will find dishes for every meal and occasion, such as Rustic Cornmeal Pancakes Dappled with American Breakfast Sausage and Slicked with Maple Syrup; Lunch Pie, aka Quiche, with Toulouse Sausage and Spinach; Vietnamese-Style Beef Sausage and Vegetable Spring Rolls with Mint Dipping Sauce; and Merguez and Apple Tagine over Couscous with Harissa. For those who like their sausage in traditional links, Wise offers expert direction for stuffing sausage into casings. <br>&nbsp;<br>Beautifully written and photographed, <i>Sausage</i> is the only book of its kind. Its array of inventive sausages and sausage-centric dishes are inspiration for both the new and the well-seasoned cook. Making sausage at home has never been so easy&#x2014;nor the results so delicious.</p><p>Victoria Wise, once a doctoral student in philosophy, cooked the first meal at the famed Chez Panisse Restaurant in Berkeley, California, in 1971. In 1973, she opened Pig-by-the-Tail, a charcuterie that helped define Berkeley&#x2019;s Gourmet Ghetto as the epicenter of culinary innovation and redefine the notion of &#x201c;deli&#x201d; in America. Twelve years later, she sold Pig-by-the-Tail to pursue her other passions&#x2014;writing, gardening, and developing fresh home cooking recipes for her books&#x2014;while she raised her son. She has written for the Los Angeles Times Syndicate, <i>Williams-Sonoma Taste</i>, and <i>Food &amp; Wine</i> and has published thirteen books on cooking and gardening. Her first book, <i>American Charcuterie: Recipes from Pig-by-the-Tail</i>, was nominated for the James Beard Cookbook of the Year award in 1986. Victoria resides in Oakland, California.Ingredients<br>&nbsp;<br>You don&#x2019;t have to stock up on exotic ingredients to use the recipes in this book. On the contrary, nearly all the ingredients are familiar and readily available. Here&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;ll need for making the sausages and for cooking the dishes that include them. The first part covers store-bought ingredients, and the second describes homemade ones.<br>&nbsp;<br>Store-Bought Ingredients<br>&nbsp;<br>Meats&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>Use meats, preferably organic, with a moderate amount of fat. If purchasing ground meat, it should have at least 15 percent fat and no more than 20 percent. If it has more, the texture of the sausage will be too soft. How finely or coarsely the meat is ground is also important. In general, a medium grind is what you want. Lamb routinely comes in a medium grind. Beef does, too, except for so-called chili grind, which is too large to soften into a tender sausage. Ground pork is generally more problematic. It is often excessively trimmed of fat to suit the no-fat mindset that currently prevails, and is too finely ground for making sausages with sufficient texture. Amending pork that is too finely ground with minced fat solves the problem, which is how the recipes in this book return succulence and texture to finely ground lean pork. Or, of course, you can grind your own meat. See page 153 for information on which cuts to use. <br>&nbsp;<br>Fats<br>&nbsp;<br>Pork Back Fat&nbsp; Pork back fat, also called fatback, barding fat, and in German speck, is the fat that runs along a pig&#x2019;s back. It is the preferred fat for sausages, both for its flavor and because it sets up well after cooking, providing succulence without flabbiness. It is not readily available in markets. But, if you purchase pork loin or pork butt untrimmed, you can trim them and stockpile the fat in the freezer to use in place of back fat for making sausages. However, that is a considerable chore for slow gain. <br>&nbsp;<br>Leaf Lard&nbsp; Leaf lard, the delicious, hard fat from around the kidneys, is also suitable for sausages, though it, too, is hard to come by. It can sometimes be special ordered, or you might check with pork purveyors at farmers&#x2019; markets, who are typically devoted to pasture raising, humanely slaughtering, and using the whole hog. <br>&nbsp;<br>Salt Pork&nbsp; To substitute for back fat or leaf lard, I use salt pork, the fat from the belly with striations of meat running through it. It is not as hard as back fat, but it is almost as satisfactory for sausages. Lean pork belly is used for bacon, the meat bands being what is wanted. For sausages, it is the opposite: the fat is the prize, so choose pieces that have the most fat. There are several brands of salt pork on the market, usually sold in vacuum-wrapped blocks of about 6 ounces. Some come still crusted in salt; some come basically desalted. The former needs to be rinsed several times and then blanched in boiling water for 5 minutes to leech out the salt. The latter is ready to go, with the proviso that you must be judicious when adding salt to the recipe. That&#x2019;s an easy call: cook a small sample of the sausage mixture, taste it, and continue from there. In recipes that call for salt pork, I have included a line that reminds you to test for saltiness before you add more salt.<br>&nbsp;<br>The most facile way to mince salt pork without a meat grinder is to freeze it partially, enough so that a knife blade glides through it without mashing it. Then use a chef&#x2019;s knife or food processor, first cutting it into small pieces, to chop it as finely as possible. <br>&nbsp;<br>Oils&nbsp; I almost always use extra virgin olive oil. Some years ago, this seemed rather fancy and imprudent for everyday use. That was then. Nowadays, many, many extra virgin olive oils are available. They range from not so expensive to quite pricy. For cooking, I use a medium-priced extra virgin oil. Lesser grades are not worth the money you pay for the word olive on the label. Instead, when I want a vegetable oil other than olive oil, I use peanut oil. It has more viscosity, which means it is not as thin and watery as many other vegetable oils, such as canola or corn oil, and it has a high smoke point, making it a good choice for high-heat saut�ing or frying. Many brands of peanut oil are on the market, and they vary in how much flavor they impart to a dish. I use a neutrally flavored peanut oil, rather than a more full-flavored, expeller-expressed artisanal product. A note of caution: keep in mind that peanut oil is potentially very harmful for those who are allergic to peanuts. When in doubt, use canola oil. <br>&nbsp;<br>Butter&nbsp; Heretical though it may sound, the difference between salted and unsalted butter is not of as much importance to me as it is to, say, a pastry chef. In general, for savory dishes, the nuance of salt in salted butter does not interfere with other tastes. I have tried many high-end, expensive domestic and imported butters and found that most are not worth the price. There is an exception. I love Parmigiano-Reggiano butter, which comes from the region where Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese is produced. It is made from cream collected from the same dairy cows that produce milk for the manufacture of the world-famous cheese. Other than butter that you might make yourself, this is the one that best retains the sweetness of truly fresh farmstead butter. Unfortunately, it is dear, maybe even a little exorbitant, so I reserve it for uses where the butter is key, as in butter sauces or for slathering on bread. For everyday cooking, I choose a good-quality domestic organic butter, either salted or unsalted.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>Herbs<br>&nbsp;<br>For the most part, I purchase herbs fresh. But experience has taught me that fresh herbs do not keep well. Indeed, no matter how they are refrigerated&#x2014;wrapped in paper towels or stood in a glass of water&#x2014;they will begin to rot after 4 or 5 days. So, as soon as a fresh herb bundle shows signs of deteriorating, I untie it, place it in a small bowl, and set it in the cupboard, uncovered, so it can slowly air dry. Then, I use it at whatever stage it is at the moment I need a teaspoon or so for the dish I am cooking. I have found this to be a very satisfactory way to have fresh herbs and freshly dried herbs always on hand. Keep in mind that dried herbs are more concentrated in flavor, so if a recipe calls for 1 teaspoon of a fresh herb and what you have is dry or almost dry, use only 1/2 teaspoon.<br>&nbsp;<br>Spices <br>&nbsp;<br>Volumes have been devoted to spices and their magical, commercial, curative, and culinary powers. Here, in brief, I will say only that I keep a shelf filled with spices, arranged in alphabetical order so they&#x2019;re easy to pull out for a recipe without fumbling through the whole cupboard. I buy them in small amounts and keep them in tightly capped jars so they stay fresh for several months.<br>&nbsp;<br>Salt and Pepper <br>&nbsp;<br>For cooking, I use kosher salt because it is inexpensive and flows freely without the use of additives. Fine sea salt is also a good choice, but if you opt for it, pull back on the measurement a bit: 1 teaspoon kosher salt is equal to 3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt. For condiment salt, I enjoy the sizes, shapes, and colors of salt crystals, which can be found in gourmet markets. They are expensive, however, and other than the fun you can have discerning minimal taste differences, I don&#x2019;t find one type is a better choice than another. So, I have settled on sel gris from the Brittany coast of France, where the salt beds have been tended as lovingly as a garden for centuries. Its gray (gris) color comes from the clay in the shallow marshes where it is harvested. It is moist and has medium-size soft crystals, so that it melts in the mouth and then disappears before intruding its presence on the dish it is garnishing. Unlike other condiment salts, sel gris is also a fine cooking salt because it readily and smoothly blends into its surround, leaving no trace of its crystalline origin. Also, it is not expensive so you can use it expansively.<br>&nbsp;<br>I employ mostly black peppercorns but use white peppercorns when I don&#x2019;t want black specks to be visible in the mix. There is not a huge taste difference between black and white pepper, except that white is a little more nutty and softer on the tongue than black pepper. I also sometimes use green peppercorns, which are elusively herby and at the same time peppery. I always grind peppercorns to order.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>American Breakfast Sausage<br>&nbsp;<br>Breakfast sausage, in patties or links, is a staple of the great American breakfast plate. It&#x2019;s an important player in the hearty, stoke-up-for-the-day meal that includes eggs, cooked anyway you&#x2019;d like; toast or pancakes; and mugs of hot java. It is served on the road as early as 4 a.m. to truckers and workers off to the fields or factories. A bit later, it feeds tourists fueling up for a day&#x2019;s adventure of skiing, mountain climbing, and other energetic activities. And on Sunday mornings, home-style cafes are filled with customers looking to splurge calories on a big breakfast out. But you don&#x2019;t need to stop at breakfast when using this sausage. It also makes a delicious taco filling or pizza topping. As often as not, breakfast sausage is served in patties, but if you prefer links, you can stuff it into sheep casing. Makes 1 pound<br>&nbsp;<br>14 ounces ground pork<br>2 ounces salt pork, fat only, minced<br>3/4 teaspoon rubbed sage (not ground sage)<br>1/2 teaspoon dried thyme<br>1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram <br>Scant 1/4 teaspoon powdered ginger<br>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br>1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste, if needed <br>&nbsp;<br>Place all the ingredients except the salt in a medium bowl, and knead with your hands until thoroughly blended. Cook and taste a small sample, then add the salt if needed. Leave in bulk and shape as directed in individual recipes or stuff into sheep casing. The sausage can be used right away. (The uncooked sausage will keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 1 week.) <br>&nbsp;<br>Saut� or grill, or cook as directed in individual recipes.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Rustic Cornmeal Pancakes Dappled with American Breakfast Sausage and Slicked with Maple Syrup<br>&nbsp;<br>The advantage of including the sausage in the pancake batter is that you don&#x2019;t have to use a second pan to cook the sausage for a side. It saves thermal unit energy, making it eco-friendly, and it saves the energy of the cook because there are fewer dishes to wash. The addition of polenta, which is more coarsely ground than cornmeal, makes for a slightly nubby texture and pleasing &#x201c;bite.&#x201d; For an everyday breakfast, I usually make the pancakes plate size, but they make a fine stack of dollar-size pancakes, too, if you&#x2019;d like to go for &#x201c;more&#x201d; rather than &#x201c;bigger.&#x201d; Use about 2 tablespoons for each dollar-size cake; you should end up with about 18 pancakes. The batter, without the added sausage, can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 4 days; just before cooking, stir in the crumbled sausage. Using grade B maple syrup accents the rustic theme. It is also the grade recommended by savvy Vermonters, who prefer its deeper, browner lushness over grade A. Makes 6 plate-size pancakes <br>&nbsp;<br>1 1/2 cups yellow cornmeal<br>1/2 cup polenta<br>1 1/2 cups boiling water<br>3/4 cup all-purpose flour<br>2 teaspoons baking powder<br>1 tablespoon sugar<br>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br>1 cup milk<br>1 large egg<br>3 tablespoons butter, melted <br>6 ounces American Breakfast Sausage (page 10)<br>Butter or ghee (see page 71), for cooking the pancakes <br>Maple syrup, preferably grade B, for serving<br>&nbsp;<br>To make the pancake batter, place the cornmeal and polenta in a large bowl and slowly pour in the boiling water, whisking to mix it in as you go. Set aside to soften the grains while preparing the remaining ingredients.<br>&nbsp;<br>In a small bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt and stir together with a fork. Combine the milk and egg in another small bowl and whisk to mix. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Add the milk mixture and melted butter to the cornmeal mixture and whisk to mix. Whisk in the flour mixture to make a thick, coarse batter. Crumble the sausage and stir it into the batter.<br>&nbsp;<br>Preheat the oven to 250�F. Generously grease a heavy, 8- to 9-inch skillet with the butter and warm it over medium-high heat. Ladle about 1/2 cup of the batter into the skillet and cook until golden on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Flip the cake with a spatula and continue cooking until golden on the second side, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer to a baking sheet and place in the oven to keep warm. Continue until all the batter is used.<br>&nbsp;<br>Place a pancake or two on individual plates and drizzle maple syrup across the top. Serve.</p><h2>Hank Greenberg in 1938: Hatred and Home Runs in the Shadow of War</h2><p>Hammerin&#x2019;&#x201d; Hank Greenberg was coming off a stellar season where he&#x2019;d hit 40 home runs and 184 RBIs, becoming only the thirteenth player to ever hit 40 or more homers (and one of only four players to have 40 or more home runs and 175 or more RBIs in a season). Even with his success at the plate, neither Greenberg nor the rest of the world could have expected what was about to happen in 1938. <br><br>From his first day in the big leagues, the New York-born Greenberg had dealt with persecution for being Jewish. From teammate Jo-Jo White asking where his horns were to the verbal abuse from bigoted fans and the media, the 6-foot-3 slugger always did his best to shut the noise out and concentrate on baseball. But in 1938, that would be more difficult then he could have ever imagined.<br><br>While Greenberg was battling at the plate, his people overseas were dealing with a completely different battle. Adolf Hitler, who had been chancellor of Germany since 1933, had taken direct control of the country&#x2019;s military in February of &#x2019;38. He then began his methodic takeover of all neighboring countries, spreading Nazism and the early stages of World War II and the Holocaust.<br><br><i>Hank Greenberg in 1938</i> chronicles the events of 1938, both on the baseball diamond and the streets of Europe. As Greenberg&#x2019;s bat had him on course for Babe Ruth&#x2019;s home run record, Hitler&#x2019;s Final Solution&#x201d; was beginning to take shape. Jews across the US, worried about the issues overseas, looked to Greenberg as a symbol of hope. Though normally hesitant to speak about the anti-Semitism he dealt with, the slugger still knew the role he was playing for so many of his people, saying I came to feel that if I, as a Jew, hit a home run, I was hitting one against Hitler.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Ron Kaplan</b> is an award-winning journalist and blogger.

He also invites the beginner to take the plunge--to set forth on the lifelong journey that is the gardener's way of life.<br><br>Gardening, Lacy explains with great eloquence and good humor, is much more than a hobby. It delights all the senses, each in its turn. It offers virtually less intellectual stimulation. It has a profound spiritual dimension, as a basis for the lifelong friendships that bind people together in the common and shared pursuit of making the earth flourish with beauty. Its joys are unlimited, for they engage its practitioners as whole persons, not partial beings.<br><br>With the kind of tantalizing prose that makes you want to reach for a trowel, Allen Lacy gives us a deeply thoughtful book on the whole enterprise of gardening.<br><br></p><p>In the grand scheme of things, a garden is a rather quotidian pleasure. Yet Allen Lacy finds a unique sensual delight in the very ordinariness of it: "It is sweet and pleasant to dig in the warm, slightly moist soil, to feel its grit and grain beneath the fingernails.... The rhythmic chore of pulling weeds soothes the soul like a mantra." The stimulation of the senses in the garden is a favorite theme that Lacy, the man who has been called "the dean of American gardeners," celebrates fully in <i>The Inviting Garden</i>, devoting a chapter to each. Lacy also proffers an affectionate look at gardening as an intellectual pleasure, with a longish but delightful discursion on botanical nomenclature, a slice of historical adventure in the story of how two rather different plants made their way from Asia to North America, a short but sweet chapter on the language of flowers, and the currently obligatory examination of the American suburban landscape. But it's in the chapters on gardening and the spirit that Lacy's charming circuitousness seems most at home: "Horticulture is sometimes described as a science, sometimes as an art, but the truth is that it is neither, although it partakes of both endeavors. It is more like falling in love, something that escapes all logic. There is a moment before one becomes a gardener, and a moment after--with a whole lifetime to keep on becoming a gardener." <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i><br>Allen Lacy is professor of philosophy at Richard Stockton College of New Jersey and the author of numerous books on gardening, including The Garden in Autumn (0-8050-4067-6, $25.00) and The Glory of Roses.

Touch a world where speed seemed the very essence of life. It is a year for which we have no expectations. It was not 1066 or 1588 or 1945, yet it was the year A. A. Milne published <i>Winnie-the-Pooh</i> and Alfred Hitchcock released his first successful film, <i>The Lodger</i>. A set of modern masters was at work--Jorge Luis Borges, Babe Ruth, Leni Riefenstahl, Ernest Hemingway, Josephine Baker, Greta Garbo, Franz Kafka, Gertrude Stein, Martin Heidegger--while factory workers, secretaries, engineers, architects, and Argentine cattle-ranchers were performing their daily tasks. </p><p> Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht opens up the space-time continuum by exploring the realities of the day such as bars, boxing, movie palaces, elevators, automobiles, airplanes, hair gel, bullfighting, film stardom, dance crazes, and the surprise reappearance of King Tut after a three-thousand-year absence. From the vantage points of Berlin, Buenos Aires, and New York, Gumbrecht ranges widely through the worlds of Spain, Italy, France, and Latin America. The reader is allowed multiple itineraries, following various routes from one topic to another and ultimately becoming immersed in the activities, entertainments, and thought patterns of the citizens of 1926. </p><p> We learn what it is to be an "ugly American" in Paris by experiencing the first mass influx of American tourists into Europe. We visit assembly lines which turned men into machines. We relive a celebrated boxing match and see how Jack Dempsey was beaten yet walked away with the hearts of the fans. We hear the voice of Adolf Hitler condemning tight pants on young men. Gumbrecht conveys these fragments of history as a living network of new sensibilities, evoking in us the excitement of another era. </p></p><p><b>Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht</b> is Albert Gu�rard Professor of Literature at Stanford University.[Gumbrecht] approaches the culture of the early twentieth century in an...ingenious and intriguing way in his <i>In 1926</i>. What interests him, he says, is to what extent a year, a simple, purely conventional unit of time, can be constituted as an object of historical inquiry--not, however, with the purpose of isolating that year's essence or significance, but rather simply by way of getting some inkling of what it was like to be alive at the time. (Edwin Frank <i>Boston Review</i>)<br><br>Written almost entirely in the present tense, and zooming cinematically from a lone woman swimming the English Channel to roof gardens in Manhattan, the book attempts to re-create the feeling of 'being-in-1926,' to borrow the author's Heideggerian formulation. The entries are a droll pastiche of literary criticism, sociological statistics, and historical anecdotes. (Adam Shatz <i>Lingua Franca</i>)<br><br>Acting as the literary equivalent of Web surfing, the innovative structure [of this book] perfectly reflects the increasingly kinetic and fragmented culture of the time, when the inherited certainties of faith and tradition were giving way to volatile and mass enthusiasms in sports and cinema and to unsettling experiments in technology, music, and gender roles. In both content and form, this work is an important advance in cultural scholarship. (Bryce Christensen <i>Choice</i>)<br><br>In the year 1926, no presidents were elected or assassinated, no wars began or ended, and no titans strode across the world stage. But beneath the year's deceptive quiet, a turbulent new world was aborning, its gestation signaled by the tortured fiction of Kafka, the ontological ponderings of Heidegger, the labyrinthine wanderings of Borges, the comedic paths of Chaplin, the daring theorizing of Freud, and he fevered rhetoric of Hitler. Gumbrecht invites us to experience this year in a book that discards the conventions of linear narrative in favor of a series of 51 essays interconnected by numerous cross-references. Acting as the literary equivalent of Web surfing, the innovative structure perfectly reflects the increasingly kinetic and fragmented culture of the time, when the inherited certainties of faith and tradition were giving way to volatile mass enthusiasms in sports and cinema and to unsettling experiments in technology, music, and gender roles. In both content and form, this work is an important advance in cultural scholarship. (Bryce Christensen <i>Booklist</i>)</p><h2>Protestants: The Birth of a Revolution</h2><p>Who were the first men and women who abandoned the Church of Rome and became the world&#39;s first Protestants? Harvard historian Steven Ozment does not present us with the remote, dusty figures of history, but rather with the shoemakers and housewives, students and politicians who were among the first followers of Martin Luther. Using pamphlets, diaries, letters, and other primary soruces, Ozment examines the origins of the Reformation and the nature of Protestantism. Rather than seeing the Reformation as the progenitor of German absolutism, as do many scholars of the period, Ozment sees in Protestantism the historic assertion of key Western values--social reform, individual religious conviction, hard work, and the rejection of corruption, hypocrisy, and empty ritual.</p><p>The Reformation comes alive in the contemporary diaries, documents, and letters of ordinary sixteenth-century men and women--a brilliant, immensely readable history by a Harvard professor and American Book Award nominee.<p>Steven Ozment is&nbsp;a professor of history at Harvard University, a recipient of Guggenheim and NEH fellowships, and winner of the Schaff History Prize from the American Church History Society in 1981. He is the author of ten books, all in print. His <i>Magdalena and Balthasar </i>and<i>&nbsp;Three Behaim Boys </i>were selections of the&nbsp;History Book Club. His <i>Age of Reform </i>was an American Book Award nominee. He is coauthor of <i>The Western Heritage</i>, a widely used textbook.</p></p><h2>Virgin Islands</h2><p>In this collection Gore Vidal addresses a wide range of topics: writers and politicians, the CIA and the American Empire, Mark Twain and George Washington, Franklin Roosevelt and Edmund Wilson. There are literary essays on Sinclair Lewis and Dawn Powell, and political pieces on America&#39;s ambivalent attitude to the UN, the disunity of the United States, and the issue of race as the global village disintegrates into fragments of uncertain national identity. Vidal&#39;s barbed pen is unsparing of reputation, whether in a savage assault on John Updike or an acidly humorous commentary on Bill Clinton. The book concludes with a claim regarding the extent of US military involvement in the British Isles.</p><p></p><h2>Yoko&#39;s Paper Cranes</h2><p>When Yoko was very small, she and her Grandmother, Obaasan, fed the cranes in the pond at the end of the garden. When Yoko moves to California, she remembers her Grandmother and Grandfather in Japan. Every week letters go back and forth. She thinks of their garden and their cranes. And when Grandmother&#39;s birthday comes, Yoko sends the most wonderful gift of all. Rosemary Wells celebrates the love between grandchildren and gradparents in this sequel to best-selling Yoko.</p><p>Rosemary Wells is the award-winning author of numerous books for children, including<i>Carry Me!</i>;<i>My</i><i>Kindergarten</i>;<i></i>the<i>New York Times</i>best-selling<i>Emily's First 100 Days of School;</i>the critically acclaimed<i>Wingwalker,</i>illustrated by Brian Selznick;<i>Yoko; Yoko Writes Her Name; Yoko's Show and Tell;</i>and the beloved McDuff series, illustrated by Susan Jeffers.Wells returns to the plucky heroine she introduced in Yoko with this wistful story about the green-eyed kitten and her far-away grandparents. Yoko writes weekly to Japan to her beloved grandmother, Obaasan, whose garden is visited each year by migrating cranes. Yoko's grandfather, Ojiisan, inspired by the winged visitors, showed his granddaughter how to fold cranes out of paper. When Obaasan's birthday approaches and Yoko doesn't have the money to buy her a present, she sends her some origami cranes, folded just as Ojiisan had taught her. Wells differentiates between the two homelands in palette and artistic style. She dresses the endearing grandparents in autumnal-hued kimonos cut out of silk-screened paper against backgrounds of woodblock-style ocean waves and wind-blown pines. Yoko, meanwhile, sports flowered patterns and spring-inspired colors; Wells outlines the heroine's vignettes in plaid frames. The boxed collages form the main images but, in traditional Japanese style, their borders are porous: leaves fall and cranes fly out into the white margins; Yoko's posted letters and origami diagrams prance across the bottom of the pages. "Soon I will come back to Japan, just like the cranes," Yoko's birthday greeting says, and while the book doesn't portray her return, youngsters will know that, no matter how far away their grandparents may be, their love will find them. Ages 3-7. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Making Tracks: The Rise of Blondie</h2><p>In the photographs of Chris Stein and words of Debbie Harry, Making Tracks details the story of Blondie, whose career propelled them from the depths of the Bowery to international renown as the hottest rock group in the world. Victor Bockris aided in the formation of the text and selection of photographs, which also provides an intimate portrait of the unique collaboration between Debbie and Chris.</p><p>Debbie Harry is probably the single most interesting and important woman in the history of rock. Well, maybe not, but all rock bios should start with hyperbole, and if anyone deserves hyperbole, it's Harry. This photo book/biography works wildly well in both its media. Chris Stein's pictures of Harry, Blondie, and the New York rock scene are not only fun in a nostalgic way, they're damn good pictures that you can stare at for hours--even without having taken the drugs that inspired them. And the story of Debbie Harry's life, as written by Harry and rock critic Victor Bockris, is two steps past weird. Who knew that Debbie was a flower child in the '60s and saw the Doors, Janis Joplin and the Velvet Underground live at some of their most celebrated shows? Or what about Debbie's stint in the psychedelic folk band Wind in the Willows? Or that Debbie was 35 years old when Blondie hit it big? Her career crosses and overruns so many moments and people in rock history that reading her bio is like driving through rock &amp; roll heaven. And, frankly, the fact that the book is full of photos of the cutest rock star in history doesn't hurt. A must for fans of Harry and historians of rock. <i>--James DiGiovanna</i><b>Lauren Cowen</b> is an award-winning journalist whose work has appeared in the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> , the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> , and other publications. <b>Victor Bockris</b> has written about the cultural heroes of the twentieth century for over thirty years.

Rather it is to use them as a powerful tool to transcend the limitations of the ego-minded and to awaken the mysterious power of prana.&#39; This volume is the second on a series on Kripalu Yoga, a radically new approach to traditional yoga practice, created by Yogi Amrit Desai in 1970. The first volume gave an overview of Kripalu Yoga theory because understanding this theory is the key to successful practice of Kripalu Yoga, which is discussed in this second volume. Here in Book II, Yogi Desai describes the techniques for gradual awakening of prana through the medium of traditional hatha yoga postures and pranayama, and also a unique method of incorporating the more advanced practices and raja yoga into the practice of hatha yoga. This paves the way for Meditation-in-Motion. Detailed instructions are given for daily practice of Stages 1 and 2 of Kripalu Yoga with the essential new characteristic of focusing inward.</p><p></p><h2>To Bury Our Fathers: A Novel of Nicaragua (English and Spanish Edition)</h2><p><p>Sergio Ram�rez, writer and former civilian leader in the Sandinista revolutionary government from 1985-1990, has now won the Cervantes Prize, the highest literary award in the Hispanic world. He wrote his great panoramic novel from exile, and this was the first Nicaraguan novel ever translated into English.

The book is episodic rather than epic, slipping from black comedy in the bullring and brothel to torture and humiliation on the battlefield. The characters &#x2013; hedonistic colonel, hopeful, Quixotic presidential candidate, dissident National Guards and hard-up prostitutes &#x2013; interweave themselves through Nicaraguan history and myth. And it is chastening to remember that some of the most awful of the events recorded &#x2013; like the caging of prisoners in a presidential zoo &#x2013; are not fiction but fact.&#x201d; <em>CITY LIMITS</em></p><p>&#x201c;Herein lies the power of this historical fiction.

Overturning both cognitive and commonplace theories about how children learn, <i>Trusting What You&#x2019;re Told</i> begins by reminding us of a basic truth: Most of what we know we learned from others.</p><p><br> </p><p><br>Children recognize early on that other people are an excellent source of information. And so they ask questions. But youngsters are also remarkably discriminating as they weigh the responses they elicit. And how much they trust what they are told has a lot to do with their assessment of its source. <i>Trusting What You&#x2019;re Told</i> opens a window into the moral reasoning of elementary school vegetarians, the preschooler&#x2019;s ability to distinguish historical narrative from fiction, and the six-year-old&#x2019;s nuanced stance toward magic: skeptical, while still open to miracles. Paul Harris shares striking cross-cultural findings, too, such as that children in religious communities in rural Central America resemble Bostonian children in being more confident about the existence of germs and oxygen than they are about souls and God.</p><p><br></p><p><br>We are biologically designed to learn from one another, Harris demonstrates, and this greediness for explanation marks a key difference between human beings and our primate cousins.

Thomas Professor of Education at Harvard University.Paul Harris has given us an intricate and beautifully detailed picture of children as budding anthropologists. They don't just learn about the world on their own, but rather from and through 'informants' who provide testimony&#x2014;which naturally raises issues of trustworthiness. This is a really terrific book from a researcher acutely attuned to children's inner lives. (Michael Tomasello, author of <i>Why We Cooperate</i>)<br><br>The importance of learning from others was oddly neglected by too many of the 20th Century pioneers of child psychology. In <i>Trusting What You're Told</i> Paul Harris reviews his and his colleagues' beautiful work demonstrating just how entwined culture is with children's development. (Peter J. Richerson, author of <i>Not By Genes Alone</i>)<br><br>In Trusting What You're Told, Harris argues that the longstanding idea that kids should be self-learners who gain knowledge mainly from their own explorations and observations is flawed. In the book's introduction, Harris notes that we adults could barely get through the day without information from other people. It's the same with kids, he says...Harris' book explores lots of interesting ideas, including the impact of a mother's level of education on a child's inquisitiveness and why kids trust what they learn from their parents. (Julie Rasicot <i>Education Week blog</i> 2012-05-25)<br><br><b>Harris</b> provides an important contribution by emphasizing that children, contrary to the view of thinkers like Piaget, do not develop only into a fixed rationality. Rather, children, from a very young age, are able to negotiate the empirical world alongside the supernatural, as well as develop through the tension created by attempting to balance truth and fantasy. Harris emphasizes the notion of testimony as a means to demonstrate the agency of the child and as a central tool through which a child is able to engage in thinking about the world. (J. A.

Through a series of interviews with participants at all levels in the resistance, Margaret Randall recounts the lives of ordinary women who became pillars of strength and perseverance during their decades-long involvement in the Sandinista struggle against the Somoza dictatorship. Believing firmly that women&#39;s liberation was inextricably linked with national liberation, many of these women were in the vanguard of the movement inspired by Augusto Sandino. At the peak of revolutionary activity, women from all classes and backgrounds comprised 30 percent of the Sandinista army. For many of these women, politics became one with the personal. Hindsight perhaps offers the greatest irony of the women&#39;s alliance with the FSLN in the fact that it was a woman, Violeta Chamorro, who challenged and defeated the Sandinistas in the free elections of 1990. Though lured by the revolutionary quixotism of a promise that lasted slightly more than a decade, the women of Sandino&#39;s Daughters will stand as a monument to all those who yearn to be free.</p><p>Born in New York in 1936, Randall grew up in New Mexico before living for twenty-three years in Mexico, Cuba, and Nicaragua. In Mexico she co-founded and edited El corno emplumado/The Plumed Horn, a vanguard bilingual literary journal of the 1960s. In Cuba and Nicaragua she worked with other artists to contribute to social change. Randall returned to the U.S. in 1984, only to face attacks on her writing that led to an effort to deport her under the McCarran-Walter Immigration and Nationality Act. After a five-year battle, joined by many of the nation&#39;s outstanding artists, writers, unionists, religious leaders, and others, she won her case in 1989.This edition of Randall's 1981 book, based on interviews with women who were active in the Sandinista party, includes a new preface. <p></p><p>Copyright 1995 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>A Time for Tea: Travels Through China and India in Search of Tea</h2><p>Traces the history of tea, and describes the author&#39;s experiences visiting the places where the tea industry began</p><p>Jason Goodwin is a historian, journalist and travel writer. He is the author of ON FOOT TO THE GOLDEN HORN: A WALK TO ISTANBUL and LORDS OF THE HORIZON: A HISTORY OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE. GREENBACK, his history of the American dollar, is being published by Hamish Hamilton in February 2003.An engaging and offbeat exploration of the tea trade by English travel-writer Goodwin, whose two grandmothers--Granny Eileen with her tea caddy from India, filled with Keemun and Lapsang Souchong; Granny Goodwin with her tea caddy from China, filled with Assam and Darjeeling--gave him an early introduction to the ritual and romance of tea. Goodwin's journey around the tea trade, which has left its ``scattered trail across the atlases and the history books,'' begins in Hong Kong, where he tracks down the elusive and eccentric ``Professor Tea.'' Then it's on to mainland China for stops in the once-busy tea-trading ports of Canton, Amoy, and Fuzhou; in the Wuyi Mountains, home of the first tea known in Europe; and in Hangzhou, capital of the green tea province. Goodwin carries with him a small library on tea, dipping into it from time to time to share stories, facts, and other choice bits with the reader. A skilled traveler as well as a talented writer, he develops contacts and picks their brains everywhere he goes-- no small feat in China. Then he heads for Calcutta (detouring briefly in the Boston of 1773--for Goodwin journeys through both space and time), where the world's biggest tea auctions are held. He visits the tea gardens of Darjeeling and the Dooars for a fascinating look at how tea is grown and processed in postimperial India. Finally, the journey ends in London, giving Goodwin the opportunity for a brief but delightful sketch of the social history of tea in Great Britain. Entertaining and elegant--perhaps not everyone's cup of tea, but boasting far more flavor than the average travel book. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

They are the &#34;salt-of-the-earth&#34; heroes and heroines who provided the moral and spiritual foundation for every generation. Some paid the ultimate sacrifice by giving their lives so that others could experience the freedom they would never know.</p><p></p><h2>Swift Horse (Mustang Mountain)</h2><p><p> <i>A story of adventure and self-discovery.</i> </p><p> Each book in the <i>Mustang Mountain</i> series is a thrilling read filled with stories of friendship, adventure and intrigue. </p><p> Alison Chant is angry at the world. She wants a new horse, but everything gets in her way. First, her mom says, 'No more horses!' Then, Alison finds the horse of her dreams. But it belongs to a young girl named Kristy Jones, who refuses to sell her beloved Skipper. </p><p> Regrettably, Alison takes matters into her own hands. She gets Skipper and herself into terrible trouble at a barrel race. </p><p> Who can save her? Will it be Chuck McClintock, the goofy, redheaded cowboy she met at Mustang Mountain Ranch? Or will it be his good-looking cousin Craig? </p><p> Alison is wondering what to do when a surprise visitor shows up to test the limits of her endurance. </p><p> Alison will need all her resources of courage and strength to heal and make things right. </p></p><p><p> As a child, <b>Sharon Siamon</b> had a passion for three things: horses, mountains, and books. She grew up in a rural community with a family too busy for horses, but as a writer of young adult novels, she finally got a chance to combine her three passions. She was inspired to write the <i>Mustang Mountain</i> series after she participated in a trail ride and had a chance to meet young women who grew up on ranches. Sharon has written several novels and series in North America and Europe. </p><p><b> Chapter 1: Bad News </b></p><p> Alison Chant stared at the telephone message in her hand. </p><p> "You can't do this to me!" she shouted into the silence of the Mustang Mountain Ranch kitchen. Her cry echoed back from the high ceiling. </p><p> Seconds later, her cousin Becky Sandersen banged through the ranch house door and skidded into the kitchen. "Alison? I heard yelling. Are you okay?" </p><p> "No, I'm not okay." Alison thrust the message at Becky. "Read this." She watched her cousin's brown eyes widen as she read the news. </p><p> "This is awful." Becky glanced up at her slender, dark-haired cousin. "Your parents aren't getting back together like they said." </p><p> "Can you believe it?" Alison's voice was high and scornful. "They didn't even have the nerve to tell me in person. They left a message with Slim, the cook." </p><p> "It's hard to get through to the ranch on the radio-phone." Becky started to make excuses. </p><p> "They could have tried a little harder." Alison shook her head. "My parents treat me like I'm some kind of suitcase they left in storage First, Dad couldn't take me to Paris in July -- even though he promised -- because he and Mom were in couples therapy. Fine, so they shipped me here to Mustang Mountain, where nobody, including you, was glad to see me." </p><p> Becky's normally rosy cheeks flushed a deeper red. "That's not true!" </p><p> "Yes, it is, and you know it," Alison rushed on, "but I didn't care because my parents were getting together again. I could live in my old house in New York, be near my friend Meg, go back to our old school. I even gave you my horse, my Shadow, because I was going home." </p><p> She grabbed the note back from Becky and smacked it with her hand. "And now this. I'm not going home. My whole life is unraveling like a cheap sweater!" </p><p> "I'm sorry ..." Becky could see that behind Alison's scornful face, she was trembling with hurt and anger. Her cousin could go from an elegant, poised fifteen-year-old to a spoiled five-year-old in a flash. </p><p> "I don't want anybody to feel sorry for me." Alison sniffed. "I want a normal life." </p><p> "It -- it's not all bad." Becky reached for her cousin's hand. "You can have Shadow back. Now that you're staying in Alberta, you won't have to leave her at Mustang Mountain." </p><p> "No. Forget it." Alison straightened her shoulders. "Shadow is your horse." </p><p> "But now you won't have to trailer her across the continent," Becky argued. "That's what you were so worried about -- that she wouldn't make the long trip..." </p><p> "I said forget it!" Alison insisted. "Shadow hates crowds and noise and traveling. She'll never make a good barrel racing horse." </p><p> That wasn't totally true, Alison thought. Her little paint mare was getting better at dealing with strange situations. But my mind is made up, she told herself firmly. I'm not like my father, who breaks promises as if they were breadsticks! </p><p> "Anyway," she gulped, "Chuck said he'd help me find a new horse before I went back east. Now that I'm not going back... we'll have lots of time to horse hunt." Chuck was a cowboy who'd turned up at Mustang Mountain last month. He'd soon be heading home to his ranch near Calgary. </p><p> Alison glanced at the note in her hand, then gazed around at the kitchen's warm wood walls. "Mom says she'll pick me up on the weekend. We're moving back into our dumpy little townhouse in Homer Creek," she sighed miserably. "In the middle of summer." </p><p> -- </p><p> Alison's mother had rented a truck and horse trailer to transport Shadow from the ranch to Homer Creek. The empty trailer bounced in the dust as she and Alison drove down the dirt road from Mustang Mountain two days later. </p><p> "Why didn't you tell me you were leaving Shadow behind?" Marion Chant complained. "All this money wasted on a horse van!" </p><p> "If you'd bothered to call me, I would have told you," Alison growled. "I'm going to be looking for a new barrel racing horse." </p><p> "We can't afford a new horse," Marion announced. "And that's final." </p><p> "What about Dad? Doesn't he have to help support me?" Alison asked. Her dad was a wealthy businessman in New York. </p><p> "Your father's paying your sister Ashley's college bills." Marion glanced at her daughter's determined face. "Your Grandmother Chant has plenty of money. You could ask her." </p><p> "Never!" Alison exploded. "Grandmother hates anything to do with the west, including western riding. You know that. But if I'm going to live in Alberta, I have to barrel race. I need a horse." </p><p> "You had a horse." Marion shook her head angrily. "I can't understand why you gave Shadow to Becky -- after all the trouble you had adopting the mare in the first place." She glanced in the rearview mirror at the cloud of dust rising behind the horse trailer. "Don't get me wrong -- I'm glad I'm not dragging that mustang down this mountain, but why on earth did you give her away?" </p><p> "Because I thought we were moving back to New York." Alison could feel her teeth starting to grind. "Remember that plan?" </p><p> "Well, then, there's a simple solution." Her mother shrugged. "Get Becky to give Shadow back." </p><p> "That may be your simple solution, but it's not mine!" Alison turned away in disgust. The little paint she'd adopted from the wild belonged at Mustang Mountain, not in some Calgary suburb. Becky loved her. And I promised, she reminded herself fiercely. </p><p> "Then the matter is closed," Marion told her. "We'll have no more discussion about horses." </p><p> Alison looked over her shoulder for one last glimpse of Mustang Mountain disappearing behind the other peaks of the Rockies. Then she hunched down in the front seat of the rental truck and prepared herself not to speak to her mother for the rest of the ride back to Homer Creek. </p></p><h2>By Its Cover: Modern American Book Cover Design</h2><p>We all know we're not supposed to judge books by their covers, but the truth is that we do just that nearly every time we walk into a bookstore or pull a book off a tightly packed shelf. It's really not something we should be ashamed about, for it reinforces something we sincerely believe: design matters. At its best, book cover design is an art that transcends the publisher's commercial imperativesto reflect both an author's ideas and contemporary cultural values in a vital, intelligent, and beautiful way.<p>In this groundbreaking and lavishly illustrated history, authors Ned Drew and Paul Sternberger establish American book cover design as a tradition of sophisticated, visual excellence that has put shape to our literary landscape. </p><p><i>By Its Cover</i> traces the story of the American book cover from its inception as a means of utilitarian protection for the book to its current status as an elaborately produced form of communication art.

Nina&#x2019;s own son is heading off to Harvard, and she hopes that he will write to her, as the Princeton student wrote to his mother and as Nina wrote to hers. But times have changed. Before Nina can persuade her child of the value of letters, she must first understand for herself exactly what it is about letters that make them so significant&#x2014;and just why she wants to receive letters from her son. Sankovitch sets off on a quest through the history of letter writing&#x2014;from the ancient Egyptians to the medieval lovers Abelard and Heloise, from the letters received by President Lincoln after his son&#x2019;s death to the correspondence of Edith Wharton and Henry James.<br> <br>Sankovitch uncovers and defines the specific qualities that make letters so special, examining not only historical letters but also the letters in epistolary novels, her husband&#x2019;s love letters, and dozens more sources, including her son&#x2019;s brief reports from college on the weather and his allowance.<br> <br>In this beautifully written book, Nina Sankovitch reminds us that letters offer proof and legacy of what is most important in life: love and connection.

The three of us had set out for the Chelsea flea market early one October morning. The market was known for its collection of used furniture, slightly bent lamps, and bizarre bric-a-brac. We had no clear goal in mind other than wandering through the outdoor aisles before the popular spot became too crowded for a large-wheeled stroller.<br> <br>It was a day of big blue skies and fresh air after a night of cleansing rain. We had nothing more pressing to do than keep our thirteen-month-old son happy. Full of young-parent energy and caffeine, we walked the sixty blocks downtown. Jack and I took turns pushing the stroller while Peter entertained us with a constant barrage of songs and chatter.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t remember who first spotted the small desk and chair, perfectly matched in slivered oak and inlaid scarring, bearing witness to at least one generation of scribblers before us. But there was no question in any of our minds: Peter thumped the desk with his fist and the set was ours.<br> <br>We shoved the stroller, desk, and chair into the back of a large yellow cab and went home to the Upper West Side. I cleared out a corner of the living room for Peter&#x2019;s desk, just below a window and to the side of our nonworking but fine-looking fireplace. From our small kitchen alcove I would be able to keep an eye on the desk, and when I sat to read on the couch facing the fireplace, Peter would be there beside me, working away while I turned pages.<br> <br>I set up jars of markers and crayons along Peter&#x2019;s desk, just where it met the brick wall. I laid out stacks of notebook paper, small index cards, and used envelopes, leaving the middle space of the desk open and clear. Above the jars I attached Peter&#x2019;s favorite postcard to the rough bricks, a portrait of Shakespeare: the writer looks grim, his lips set in a downward line between goatee and mustache. Five ounces of blue sticky gum held the card straight. Everything was set and ready.<br> <br>Peter toddled on sturdy legs over to his desk, pulled out his chair, and began to scribble. He quickly covered an index card with blue marker squiggles, then carefully worked the card into an envelope. His face serious, he turned and handed me the envelope. I had received my first letter from Peter.<br> <br>Flash-forward seventeen years, and it is another beautiful fall morning. Peter&#x2019;s old desk now sits in a sunroom off the main drag of the suburban home we moved to when our fourth child was born. Peter is away at college. We dropped him off there in August, moving him into his dorm on his eighteenth birthday. After getting him settled, we went out for lunch, to celebrate the birthday and the start of college.<br> <br>&#x201c;After we eat, you guys should get going,&#x201d; Peter said to me as we sat down in the French restaurant a block away from Harvard Yard.<br> <br>&#x201c;No problem.&#x201d; I nodded. I understood. He wasn&#x2019;t saying &#x201c;hit the road&#x201d; to me, not really. He was just saying that it was time for him to go his own way, and that family was not invited.<br> <br>Within hours of leaving him on the steps of Memorial Hall, I got a text on my phone: &#x201c;Love you.&#x201d;<br> <br>I showed it to Jack.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nice,&#x201d; he said, and I agreed. Very nice.<br> <br>But I wanted more. I wanted more than the texts and tweets and the occasional phone calls I got over the next few weeks. I wanted a letter.<br> <br>&#x201c;Drop me a line sometime,&#x201d; goes the old farewell. A casual request, but for me a strong desire. With one child off at college, and three more to go, joining their brother in places near or far but not home with me, I wondered: Why does a letter mean so much?</p><h2>Judy Coleman</h2><p>Signed, limited edition over-sized hardback book with dust jacket titled JUDY COLEMAN.

Since recent unsettling events, she has made some progress. While she still has writer's block, she doesn't suffer from it. She's still a hermit, but she has allowed some of her class members into her life. She is no longer numb, angry, and sardonic: she is merely numb and bemused, which is as close to happy as she plans to get. Amy is calm.</p><p>So, when on New Year's morning she shuffles out to her backyard garden to plant a Norfolk pine, she is wholly unprepared for what happens next.</p><p>Amy falls down.</p><p>A simple accident, as a result of which something happens, and then something else, and then a number of different things, all as unpredictable as an eight-ball break. At first the changes are small, but as these small events carom off one another, Amy's life changes in ways that range from ridiculous to frightening to profound.</p><p>This most reluctant of adventurers is dragged and propelled by train, plane, and automobile through an outlandish series of antic media events on her way to becoming--to her horror--a kind of celebrity. And along the way, as the numbness begins to wear off, she comes up against something she has avoided all her life: her future, that "sleeping monster, not to be poked."</p><p>Jincy Willett's <i>Amy Falls Down</i> explores, through the experience of one character, the role that accident plays in all our lives. "You turn a corner and beasts break into arias, gunfire erupts, waking a hundred families, starting a hundred different conversations. You crack your head open and three thousand miles away a stranger with Asperger's jump-starts your career."</p><p>We are all like Amy. We are all wholly unprepared for what happens next.</p><p>Also, there's a basset hound. <br>An NPR Best Book of 2013</p></p><p>JINCY WILLETT<b> </b>is the author of <i>Jenny and the Jaws of Life,</i> <i>Winner of the National Book Award,</i> and <i>The Writing Class,</i> which have been translated and sold internationally<i>.</i> Her stories have been published in <i>Cosmopolitan</i>, <i>McSweeney's Quarterly,</i> and other magazines. She frequently reviews for <i>The New York Times</i> <i>Book Review</i>. Willett spends her days parsing the sentences of total strangers and her nights teaching and writing&#x2015;sometimes, late at night, in the dark, she laughs inappropriately.CHAPTER ONE <br>&nbsp; <br>Accident <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Because the Norfolk pine was heavy, and also because she was wearing house slippers, having not yet dressed for the day, Amy took her time getting to the raised garden. Her house slippers were fuzzy, oversized, and floppy, and if she moved too fast, she would walk right out of them. <br>She was not yet dressed for the day because she had no reason to dress until much later, at which time she&#x2019;d have to dress uncomfortably, and she was in no hurry to do that. At three o&#x2019;clock a reporter from <i>The</i> <i>San Diego Union-Tribune</i> was coming to interview Amy as part of some bogus series about local writers. Although she&#x2019;d specified no current events and especially no photographs, she didn&#x2019;t trust a reporter who sounded on the phone as though she were eight years old and couldn&#x2019;t think of anything funnier than not wanting your face on public display. Imagine, her laughter implied, denying the world the chance to gaze upon you. So Amy dreaded the interview but was not actively doing so, or thinking about it at all, as she shuffled toward the raised garden with the Norfolk pine. <br>She shuffled past her mimosa tree, where three goldfinches clung to a thistle-seed feeder, and past her green plastic pseudo-Adirondack chairs, covered with two seasons&#x2019; worth of dirt, seeds, and leaves, which she really must hose off one of these days. She shuffled closer to the raised garden, as the screen door banged behind her and Alphonse jingled past and up ahead of her, his great basset nose zeroing in on the very spot where she planned to dig, as though her trail had magically preceded her. James Thurber said that his bloodhound always seemed more interested in where he&#x2019;d been than where he was; Alphonse had an uncanny fascination with where she planned to be, and a genius for thwarting her: ordinarily a sedate plodder, he could materialize in a chair just as she was about to sit down; if she suddenly felt peckish at two in the morning, he&#x2019;d be waiting in front of the refrigerator, his eyes glowing red in the dark kitchen. Now he sniffed round and round the digging spot. &#x201c;No!&#x201d; she shouted. &#x201c;Desist, you miscreant!&#x201d; Alphonse feigned deafness, as though so anxious to relieve himself that he could think of nothing else, which was mendacious, as he usually slept in until midmorning and even then typically put off his bathroom break until noon. He was just messing with her head. <br>So she shuffled a little faster, intent on reaching her goal before Alphonse fully committed himself to his, and when she came to the raised garden, her eyes fixed on Alphonse, and lifted her right foot to step onto the low brick wall, she misjudged its elevation by perhaps a quarter inch, not enough to stub her toes and trip, just enough to throw her very slightly off-balance, the sole of her foot catching and scraping on the rough brick rather than coming straight down to meet it, and still she rose, her attention now divided between Alphonse and the heavy potted pine, her center of gravity higher than usual as she clutched it to her midriff, and then the slipper on her left foot did flop off and she did stub her left toes, or rather skinned the tops of them on the harsh edge of the brick, which really shouldn&#x2019;t have been catastrophic, but was, because now she was thinking about three different things, Alphonse, her toes, and the Norfolk pine, so that somehow her balance shifted forward, and certain physical forces, inertia and momentum, began to announce themselves, clearing their throats politely. All was not lost at this point, they said, but a fall was possible, and Amy, over-thinking as usual, realizing that in such a fall the <i>pine</i> might suffer irreparably, focused on cradling it in such a way that <i>it</i> would not suffer, as though she were sixteen years old and lithe and presented with a smorgasbord of landing-position selections, none of which would injure her in the slightest, whereas what she should have done was jettison the damn plant and save herself, but no, and then she had actually lost balance and was pitching forward, her legs and feet heroically striving to catch up with her upper body, so that, still falling, she gathered speed, and, seeing that all was lost, she began to twist around in order to land on her back, and then her bare left heel slammed down on a sprinkler head and she heard her ankle crunch, but felt nothing because within the time it would have taken for the pain message to arrive in her brain, she had knocked herself out on the birdbath. <br> <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by Jincy Willett <br></p><h2>The Short Stories of Anton Chekhov (Modern Library, 50.5)</h2><p>22 of Chekhov&#39;s short stories revealing his genius at portraying the human condition</p><p></p><h2>Lovely Me: The Life of Jacqueline Susann</h2><p>Traces the life of Jacqueline Susann, from her troubled childhood, through a womanhood filled with frustrations, fading glamour, and failing health, to her years as the best-selling author of &#34;Valley of the Dolls.&#34;</p><p>Pioneering feminist health scholar and <i>Ms.</i> contributor Barbara Seaman dishes all the delicious dirt on Jackie Susann, who left more dirt in her wake than most tornadoes: countless affairs with the famous and infamous (including Ethel Merman!), a scary passion for her father (whom Jackie, age 4, caught in flagrante delicto with a woman not his wife), and a cancer-ravaged life, exacerbated by enough drug binges and showgirl catfights to fill the most notorious roman � clef in world history, <i>Valley of the Dolls</i>. Seaman also does an investigative reporter's spade work. She explains how Susann's ambitious marketing ideas revolutionized the book business--at 19 million copies sold, <i>Valley</i> is the top-scoring novel ever written--and she checks out the sad history of Susann's autistic son, who was stashed away in a horrifying institution (which was the subject of a Geraldo Rivera expos�), and then mysteriously disappeared from public view. Susann's poodle Josephine apparently took her son's place in her heart, and her book about the pooch, <i>Every Night, Josephine!</i>, launched her weird bestseller career. <i>Valley of the Dolls</i> is amazingly entertaining, but unless you've read <i>Lovely Me</i>, you don't know Jacqueline Susann.10 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>I&#39;m Only One Man!</h2><p>The popular daytime TV personality recounts his first experiences on television, his family life, his partnership with Kathie Lee Gifford, and his most memorable moments on the set of <em>Live with Regis and Kathie Lee.</em></p><p>The irrepressible talk-show host here gives an account of his whirlwind activities over the course of a year in a diarylike format. Although at times it seems Philbin would have been better served by a more straightforward autobiography, since some of his best anecdotes are sandwiched in between his kvetching about his stomach troubles and his tennis game, there are still some great stories here. He talks about his idols Perry Como and Dean Martin, his ritual dinners with Charles Grodin and Jack Paar, why he walked off <i>The Joey Bishop Show</i>, and the origins of his mock feud with Gelman, his baby-faced producer. He also takes more than a few hilarious, merciless digs at cohost Kathie Lee Gifford. Walter Winchell once described Philbin as "show biz from head to toenails," and is he ever--brimming with sentiment and painfully sincere, he's also a hardworking trouper and a shameless name-dropper (it seems he's kept every friend he's ever made and mentions each and every one of them here). But hey, if Kathie Lee can make the best-seller list (<i>I Can't Believe I Said That!</i> [1992]), it'll be a cinch for Reege. <i>Joanne Wilkinson</i>The morning talk show Live with Regis and Kathie Lee has been so successful in building a huge base of loyal fans that it requires no crystal ball to predict that Regis's account of the year 1994 in his life will sell very well. With gentle, self-deprecating humor, the performer, assisted by freelancer Zehme, recalls his youth in the Bronx, his education at Notre Dame, his early years on TV in San Diego and Los Angeles, his stint as second banana to comic Joey Bishop and his eventual triumph in New York. He relates many anecdotes about his friends among the famous and the lesser-known and about working with co-star Kathie Lee Gifford and producer Michael Gelman, who serves as his mock whipping boy on camera. And he describes the almost incredibly frantic pace of his daily existence, aptly referring to himself as a "commercial machine." Still, as he notes, after a long climb, his life is "pretty darn good."

Told from generation to generation, they are as fascinating now as they were to their original listeners. This wonderfully rich and varied collection are ten of the best-loved traditional Irish stories, retold by author and poet Una Leavy. The post of Gold captures the trickery and mischief of leprechauns; the story of Oisin in Tir-na-Nog, and marks the end of the great Fianna. From 2000 years ago comes The Children of Lir. These are all stories to be treasured for years to come. Susan Field&#39;s beautiful illustrations are inspired by ancient Celtic art and culture. They capture the wealth of tradition, the humour and the magic of these great stories.</p><p>Una Leavy is the author of Harry&#39;s Stormy Night and Goodbye Pappa.

It's 1959 (the book says 1958, but that must be a mistake, because everyone knows Buddy Holly died in a plane crash on February 3, 1959), and Sam McCain--"a young lawyer in a town that already had too many lawyers"--is working as an investigator in Black River Falls, Iowa, for Judge Esme Anne Whitney, a wealthy and eccentric old woman who smokes Gauloises in Chesterfield country and takes pleasure in shooting McCain with rubberbands while they confer.<p> The day after a long drive to and from what turns out to be Buddy Holly's last concert before his fatal plane crash, McCain finds the murdered wife of Judge Whitney's rotten nephew, Kenny, and then is unable to stop Kenny from killing himself. Everybody, including the town's loutish police chief, is sure that Kenny killed his wife--only McCain has his doubts.</p><p> Complicating things are the troubles of a local black former football star now crippled by booze, and those of McCain's teenage sister who is trying to abort her baby. The period details about race and sex seem dead right; the people of Black River Falls, especially McCain's family and various girlfriends, are all sharply-sketched; and even the very late appearance of a possible villain can't spoil the considerable fun.</p><p> Previous examples of Gorman's craft, or sullen art, include <i>Daughter of Darkness</i>, <i>Black River Falls</i>, <i>Dark Trail</i>, <i>The First Lady</i>, <i>Hawk Moon</i>, <i>The Marilyn Tapes</i>, <i>Senatorial Privilege</i>, <i>Trouble Man</i>, and <i>Cage of Night</i>. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p><p>Ed Gorman is an award winning American author best known for his crime and mystery fiction.

She was responsible for the paper's coverage of Procter &amp; Gamble for three years.Wall Street Journal reporter Swasy was, she tell us, spied upon, followed, and bugged while writing this admirable--if ultimately somewhat disappointing--history of the dark side of Ivory-soap and Tide manufacturer Proctor &amp; Gamble. According to hundreds of interviews Swasy conducted with current and former P&amp;G managers, contractors, and company watchdogs, P&amp;G--a founder of the national brand name and a pillar of Cincinnati civic life since 1837--turns out to be a paranoid corporate strongman obsessed with controlling the lives of its employees and preserving the sacrosanct reputation of its brands. In chapters devoted, respectively, to the single-minded career of CEO Ed Artzt, to racism and sexism at headquarters, to totalitarian demands for worker loyalty, to hushed-up environmental debacles in P&amp;G plants around the nation, and, finally, to the ruthless marketing here and abroad of brands--including Crest, Pampers, Tide, and, most notoriously, Rely tampons (which were responsible for a number of deaths in the toxic-shock syndrome scandal of the 1970's), Swasy thoroughly dismantles P&amp;G's wholesome image. The documentation of various kinds of corporate malfeasance--including the well-publicized but still shocking episode in which P&amp;G persuaded friendly local county law-enforcement officials secretly to search the private phone records of hundreds of P&amp;G employees, looking for calls to Swasy's Pittsburgh phone after an unfavorable story by her appeared in The Wall Street Journal--is heroic. But the cumulative tale isn't shapely enough to stand on its own as a cautionary story, and Swasy is too close to it to ask what it tells us about corporate America today. For all Swasy's careful work, the book finally has a little ring of an author's rant. Must reading, however, for company watchers, P&amp;G shareholders, curious consumers, and citizens of Cincinnati.

In addition to illustrations full of charming details discovered over many readings and a generous appearance of pink tutus and ballet slippers, it's probably this character's spunk and persistence. In this story, while chugging along on her grandparents' canal boat, the mouseling is determined to "think up a special dance." At first, her grandparents gently remind her that all paws are needed "on deck," then sternly suggest that sailors are too busy to dance, and so it goes until Angelina tumbles into a can of oil and ruins her costume.

Thirty-two years before it was made into a movie, <i>Harriet the Spy</i> was a groundbreaking book: its unflinchingly honest portrayal of childhood problems and emotions changed children's literature forever. Happily, it has neither dated nor become obsolete and remains one of the best children's novels ever written. The fascinating story is about an intensely curious and intelligent girl, who literally spies on people and writes about them in her secret notebook, trying to make sense of life's absurdities. When her classmates find her notebook and read her painfully blunt comments about them, Harriet finds herself a lonely outcast. Fitzhugh's writing is astonishingly vivid, real and engaging, and Harriet, by no means a typical, loveable heroine, is one of literature's most unforgettable characters. <i>School Library Journal</i> wrote, "a tour de force... bursts with life." The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books called it "a very, very funny story." And <i>The Chicago Tribune</i> raved, "brilliantly written... a superb portrait of an extraordinary child."Harriet M. Welsch is a spy. In her notebook, she writes down everything she knows about everyone, even her classmates and her best friends. Then Harriet loses track of her notebook, and it ends up in the wrong hands. Before she can stop them, her friends have read the always truthful, sometimes awful things she&#39;s written about each of them. Will Harriet find a way to put her life and her friendships back together?</p><h2>More Miniature Perfume Bottles</h2><p>An extravagant array of miniature perfume bottles fills these full-color pages, pure rapture for those who love scent, beautiful glasswork, and the mystique of the truly elegant.

In November 1917 during low-level bombing and strafing attacks, he was shot down three times by ground fire. He spent eight months at the front and accumulated 222 hours of flight time in Sopwith Pups and Camels during a staggering 118 patrols; being engaged in combat fifty-six times. He lived to retire from the RAF as an air vice-marshal in 1946. Author of three war books, this is by far his best. Lee puts you in the cockpit in a riveting account of life as a fighter pilot at the front.

Whidden, president of North Sails, has provided a readable volume which starts with sail material and concludes with the care thereof. In between, there is much valuable information regarding such matters as design and development, sail and rigging trim, and choice of inventory for various sailing interests. While the book is aimed at the specialist, the style is clear enough for most sailors. Highly recommended for all libraries with a literate sailing clientele.

With <em>Natural Selection</em>, he brings together the best of these previously uncollected essays, including a few written expressly for this volume. <br> The range of topics is spellbinding. Writing with insight, humor, and a famously deft touch, he offers sharp-edged perspectives on such diverse subjects as Federico Fellini and Jean Renoir, Norman Mailer and Ralph Ellison, Marlon Brando and Groucho Marx, Duke Ellington and Bob Dylan, horror and noir, the cartoon version of <em>Animal Farm</em> and the comic book series <em>Classics Illustrated</em>. Giddins brings to criticism an uncommon ability, long demonstrated in his music writing, to address in very few words an entire career, so that we get an in-depth portrait of the artist beyond the film, book, or recording under review. For instance, Giddins offers a stunning reappraisal of Doris Day, who he terms "the coolest and sexiest female singer of slow ballads in film history." He argues eloquently for a reconsideration of the forgotten German-language novelist Soma Morgenstern. In a section on comedy, he offers fresh perspectives on the three great silent film stars--Chaplin, Keaton, and Lloyd--while resurrecting the legendary Jack Benny and reevaluating the controversial Jerry Lewis. There's also a memorable look at Bing Crosby's film career (he calls Crosby's blockbuster <em>Going My Way</em> "a neglected masterpiece") and a close examination of Marcel Carne's beloved <em>Children of Paradise</em>. Of course, Giddins also supplies excellent commentary on jazz: major and underrated figures, and especially the uses of jazz in film. <br> A wonderful gathering of little-known treasures, <em>Natural Selection</em> will broaden the perception of Gary Giddins as one of our most important cultural critics.<br></p><p><br><strong>Gary Giddins</strong> wrote the <em>Village Voice's</em> "Weather Bird" column for more than thirty years. His eight books and three documentary films have garnered unparalleled recognition for jazz, including a National Book Critics Circle Award in Criticism, two Ralph J. Gleason Music Book Awards, six ASCAP-Deems Taylor Awards, a Guggenheim, and a Peabody. He lives in New York City.<br><br>"A critic who wears his erudition lightly, writes with an impeccable combination of verve and sobriety and, above all, makes you see (and hear) the objects of his ruminations.... An engaging mind fully engaged with significant cultural objects in which it finds useful, surprising resonances.... We see our culture more clearly because of the force, intelligence and alertness to overlooked detail that Giddins brings to his readings of a past that remains stubbornly, if sometimes only subliminally, present in our own less acute remembrances."-Richard Schickel, <em>Los Angeles Times</em><p></p><br>"Just try to read all of 'Natural Selection' without buying at least a few CD's and DVD's; the Criterion Collection should pay Giddins a commission."--<em>New York Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"In an age of blogs and the everyman critic, it's reassuring to know people as brilliant as Giddins are still ready to offer insights only a true critic can provide. This is an exceptional addition to a remarkable career.... Nowhere else in his works do we find such a wide range of subjects, which proves his perceptive talents and in-depth knowledge of the mediums of which he writes are unequalled."--<em>Library Journal</em> (starred review)<p></p><br>"Gary Giddins is well known for his sensitive and brilliantly insightful books and articles about jazz, but it turns out he is equally at home, and equally enthralling, writing about the movies (foreign and domestic), TV and radio personalities, fiction, authors of all sorts, and even rock music. The essays that make up this <em>Natural Selection</em>, taken individually, are often as good as humanist, personal criticism can possibly get, and taken as a whole, the book is very difficult to lay aside. You think you'll just read one more piece, and then you're into another couple because the ideas and style are so inviting, enjoyable, and revealing. When you've finished the whole thing, all you want is MORE!"--Peter Bogdanovich<p></p><br>"I'm not surprised that our premier jazz critic also turns out to be such an avid, knowledgeable writer on film as well as a discerning literary reader. Giddins's enthusiasm is contagious--his writing invariably gives genius its due. His essays on movies, music, and books are not only fluent and entertaining; they pack a shameless quotient of appreciation, information, and discrimination into a brief compass." --Morris Dickstein, author of <em>Gates of Eden, Leopards in the Temple</em>, and <em>A Mirror in the Roadway</em><p></p><br>"Gary Giddins is not just giving us reviews--he's giving us autobiography, sharing with us the tastes, moods, observations, and passions of a man gifted with a pitch-perfect ear and a discerning eye. <em>Natural Selection</em> is his guided tour through the artifacts of his evolution. And along the way we evolve too as we realize we are traveling with a great sharer and passionate teacher. Listen and learn." --Philip Kaufman, film director<p></p><br>"Gary Giddins is one of our most important cultural critics, but it's only with this collection that I realized just how knowledgeable and expansive his sensibility is. I'm particularly glad to have in book form his DVD columns for <em>The New York Sun</em>, where he's given the space to resurrect lesser-known films, place them in context, and make readers want to get hold of and watch them with Giddins's book as guide. A must-have for every movie-lover's shelf!" --Molly Haskell, critic and author of <em>From Reverence to Rape: The Treatment of Women in the Movies</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Private [Large Print]</h2><p>Used.

Matisse&#39;s odalisques and Picasso&#39;s demoiselles, Bonnard&#39;s bathers, Balthus&#39;s Lolitas and de Kooning&#39;s harpies all appear in this provocative and original book, as do the nudes of Maillol, Schiele, Modigliani, Pascin, Lachaise, Stanley Spencer, Lucian Freud, and Philip Pearlstein. By exploring the relationship between artist and model - as well as the artist&#39;s relationships with the other women in his life, with historical images of the nude, whether the results yield the near-portraiture of Freud or the violent abstraction of Picasso. The complex relationship between art and biography is also considered, particularly in the work of Bonnard and Schiele, whose marriages radically altered their treatments of the nude. While artists such as Philip Pearlstein may proclaim that &#39;content is not interesting,&#39; and Matisse insisted, &#39;I do not create a woman, I make a picture,&#39; many of the best and most advanced artists of the century have painted or sculpted - often obsessively - the female nude. With passion and insight, Janet Hobhouse shows how no other subject addresses as directly or as fundamentally the questions of who we are and how we love.&#34;</p><p>Thirteen male artists who have painted or sculpted female nudes are the focus of this brilliant, shrewdly debunking, lushly illustrated study. Hobhouse, biographer of Gertrude Stein ( Everybody Who Was Anybody ) and arts contributor to Newsweek , claims that Picasso's showmanship kept him "safe and unknowable" in erotic pictures devoid of intimacy. She has little use for Matisse's ethereal concubines or Maillol's remote icons, and in Jules Pascin's passive young girls she discerns the artist's refusal to engage his emotions. Other painters who used the female nude to explore recurrent themes get higher marks, among them Modigliani, whose models embodied the tension between the abstract and the real, and Schiele, in whose work the contrast between clothing/nakedness symbolizes the theme of emergence or coming into being. Feminist in spirit, Hobhouse's perceptive survey demonstrates that the human body most fully serves art when the artist responds to the whole truth of a person. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.This generously illustrated study examines the work and lives of 13 major artists, all male, who renewed and reinterpreted the nude. Hobhouse theorizes that in painting nudes these artists lay bare their own psyches; the result, distilled from a more complex whole, portrays their icy/boiling, restless/passive relationships with the women who inspired them. Humor, eroticism, narration, bewilderment, passssion, spirituality, voyeurism, power, poetry, reverence, petrifactionthese readings are all valid, because for these artists, the mystery of sexuality remains unfathomable. Recommended for all who enjoy art.

But destiny has great plans for this no-man's-son, taking him from prophesying before the High King Vortigern to the crowning of Uther Pendragon . . . and the conception of Arthur -- king for once and always.</p></p><p>Initially published nearly thirty years ago, Mary Stewart's <i>The Crystal Cave</i> has been spellbinding readers and converting them into serious Arthurian buffs ever since. The first in a series of four books, this novel focuses on the early life of Merlin the magician, and the political developments of fifth-century Britain. Not for the fainthearted, this verbose text pays careful attention to historical details and methodical plot development.<p> Merlin's childhood is formed by the absence of his reticent, convent-bound mother and his unnamed and unknown father. As the bastard grandson of a local king, Merlin is the object of both envy and ridicule. His strange powers and predictions earn him greater status as a pariah, and he leaves home as a preadolescent. Returning years later as a young man--empowered by self-knowledge and magic--Merlin finds himself caught in the currents of the shifting kingdoms.</p><p> As an established classic in this genre, and the first in a popular series, <i>The Crystal Cave</i> introduces this familiar character with fresh sensitivity. While readers looking for the romance of <i>First Knight</i> will be disappointed, those happy with tight writing and a complex story line will be satisfied. <i>--Nancy R.E. O'Brien</i></p>If you haven&#39;t read Mary Stewart&#39;s Arthurian Saga, you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re missing. They are must reads for any romance reader, for any lover of Arthurian legend, for any history buff, for any voracious reader, and may be the books to get non-readers started. Basically, they should be read by everyone! Mary Stewart&#39;s research for these books is phenomenal. Her understanding of myth and its relationship to fact is remarkable. The books are complex, yet incredibly inviting and you will absolutely love the characters. They also weave together so beautifully that you won&#39;t be able to read only one. Two things I find particularly interesting in this series is the portrayal of Arthur and the fall of Camelot. Arthur represents all of humanity in these books as opposed to the more mythical figure you usually see. And the fall of Camelot is more internal rather than external--more about the passions and lusts in the heart rather than a more obvious loss of power. The books go in this order: The Crystal Cave, The Hollow Hills, The Last Enchantment, The Wicked Day.

Witt (a journalist), Paget (a political scientist), and Matthews (History/UC Berkeley) offer an authoritative, detailed exploration of women on the political scene from Jeannette Rankin's bid for Congress in 1916 to the triumph of the self-styled ``Thelma and Louise'' of the 1992 elections--Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer. In doing so, the authors blend their expertise seamlessly to illuminate the rocky road of women who have sought political power. Early on, they explain, women in Congress were widows who inherited their husbands' seats. Among the pioneers elected on their own merits were California's Helen Gahagan Douglas, who wheeled a shopping cart into Congress to spotlight economic distress, and Maine Senator Margaret Chase Smith, who wanted no part of being a feminist. But as the women's movement gained strength, more women sought office--though, faced with the burdens of raising money and attacks on their femininity, most tried to blend with male politicians. Later, campaigns of the 1980's played to the ``gender gap.'' The Democrats counted on Geraldine Ferraro's vice-presidential bid to pull the women's vote, but Republican analysts played to women's concerns about the economy and crime, and won. According to the authors, Anita Hill turned that around, and soon women coalesced around women: Checks poured into organizations like Emily's List, which funds women candidates, and women ran and won on women's issues, proclaiming their ``different voice.'' Facts, numbers, and charts add weight to moving anecdotes from women like Colorado Congresswoman Pat Schroeder, Texas Governor Ann Richards, and others. What's in the future? The authors predict that as more women enter politics, campaigns will become issue-oriented rather than gender-oriented. Thoughtful personal reflection and nitty-gritty political scheming: an important contribution to the always fascinating story of the scramble for power. (B&amp;w illustrations) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>A journalist, a political scientist and a historian at UC Berkeley, respectively, here offer a broad and anecdotal account that instructively analyzes the evolving history of women as political candidates. The earliest candidates, like Jeannette Rankin who in 1916 became the first woman member of Congress, invoked altruism as their motivation; only after the birth of feminism could women admit to ambition. Despite increases in numbers over the years, the comparative paucity of women politicians means that those who run are likely to be viewed through expectations born of feminine stereotypes. They must face questions about dress, motherhood and marriage that male politicans are never asked. Although women have recently begun to succeed in political fundraising, mobilizing the "women's vote" is more difficult and the authors offer only a few tentative suggestions. More perspicacious is their criticism of media coverage of women politicians and their analysis of how individual candidates "phrase" the gender issue. Nonetheless, the authors conclude that women, collectively and individually, are gradually accruing the power necessary to reframe the issues that affect them. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Stray Bullets: Sunshine &amp; Roses Volume 2</h2><p>What would you do for love?

When a boy starts to sail at the age of six, it is also likely that he might choose the sea and sailing ships as his subject. Such was the case for Christopher Blossom, who, by the time he left the Parsons School of Design and Robert Bourke&#x2019;s Design Studio, could visualize a finished boat from only its plans&#x2014;and draw the craft from any angle. Before Blossom was twenty, he had sailed under square rig aboard the brigantine Young America. Blossom combines his appreciation for the beauty and the menace of the sea with his love of maritime history and ship construction. Before Blossom paints a vessel, he is likely to study the ship&#x2019;s blueprint to learn about it hull design, length, tonnage and deck layout. Blossom&#x2019;s historically accurate ships and harbors are combined with color, light and composition to capture the mood of a voyage and convey the essence of the seafaring experience.<br> At the age of twenty, he won a Gold Medal at the Society of Illustrators Scholarship Exhibition. His dual vocation of experiencing the sea and then painting both nautical history and some of the greatest modern places to sail, was truly launched. <br> Blossom became both a charter member <br> and an artist of the American Society of Marine Artists, serving as its president from 1983 to 1986. His awards include a Gold Medal from the National Academy of Western Art for his painting of ships in Monterey. Saluted as an undisputed master, Blossom has exhibited his art at the Gilcrease Museum, the Colorado Museum of History, the prestigious Prix de West Invitational and the Artists of America show. Blossom continues to achieve artistic honors including the Robert Lougheed Memorial Award at the 2001 Prix de West.<br> Almost the only time he isn&#x2019;t painting is when he is sailing. Blossom, who recently spent a year sailing around the Caribbean with his wife and two sons says of his love, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a hobby, it&#x2019;s a way of life. When I look at the ocean, I get the same feeling pilots must get when they look to the sky.&#x201d;</p><h2>Illustration Studio: Beginning Manga: An interactive guide to learning the art of manga illustration</h2><p><p><b>Learn to illustrate and create unique manga art in this fun and engaging, step-by-step book.</b></p><p><i>Beginning Manga</i> treats aspiring illustrators to a fun, interactive learning experience with a variety of creative prompts, tips, exercises, and engaging step-by-step projects.

The work remains intensely alive in a climate of opinion in which strong skepticism about scientific realism is motivated by social and political considerations that could scarcely be more at variance with Duhem's ultra-Catholic conservatism. The introduction by Jules Vuillemin, at once expository and critical, is the clearest commentary on Duhem's philosophy of science that I have had the pleasure of reading.

He aims to recover Shakespeare's ideas and beliefs and to make his work once again a recognized source for the serious study of moral and political problems.<br><br>In essays looking at <i>Julius Caesar, Othello,</i> and <i>The Merchant of Venice,</i> Bloom shows how Shakespeare presents a picture of man that does not assume privileged access for only literary criticism. With this claim, he argues that political philosophy offers a comprehensive framework within which the problems of the Shakespearean heroes can be viewed. In short, he argues that Shakespeare was an eminently political author. Also included is an essay by Harry V.

And nowhere was it more mad than in Chicago at the dawn of the Roaring Twenties. Speakeasies thrived, gang war shootings announced Al Capone's rise to underworld domination, Chicago's corrupt political leaders fraternized with gangsters and the frenzy of stock market gambling was rampant. Enter a slick, smooth-talking, charismatic lawyer named Leo Koretz, who enticed hundreds of people to invest as much as $30 million&#x2014;upwards of $400 million today&#x2014;in phantom timberland and non-existent oil wells in Panama. When Leo's scheme finally collapsed in 1923, he vanished, and the Chicago state's attorney, a man whose lust for power equalled Leo's own lust for money, began an international manhunt that lasted almost a year. When finally apprehended, Leo was living a life of luxury in Nova Scotia under the assumed identity of a book dealer and literary critic. His mysterious death in a Chicago prison topped anything in his almost-too-bizarre-to-believe life.</p><p><i>Empire of Deception</i> is not only an incredibly rich and detailed account of a man and an era; it is a fascinating look at the methods of swindlers throughout history. Leo Koretz was the Bernie Madoff of his day, and Dean Jobb shows us that the dream of easy wealth is a timeless commodity.</p></p><p><p><b>DEAN JOBB</b> is the author of six books, including <i>Calculated Risk: Greed, Politics and the Westray Tragedy</i>, which won the City of Dartmouth book award and was runner-up for the National Business Book Award.

Special education laws govern eligibility, IEPs, evaluations, placement, educational progress, transition plans, discipline, and educational records - and are vitally important to parents of disabled children, educators, child advocates, school psychologists, health care providers, and school administrators.</p><p>Peter and Pamela Wright accomplish several goals in this comprehensive reference book. They provide an overview of law and special education law, along with the full text of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1997, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, and implementing regulations. They include a casebook of special education decisions by the U. S. Supreme Court, including Florence County School District IV v. Shannon Carter and the recent decision in Cedar Rapids v. Garret F. Woven through the book are clear, concise definitions, information about educational research, and practical tips about how to deal with school officials. <p>This book is a useful reference for experienced attorneys and for non-lawyer parents and educators.</p>Raising a child with a disability is physically, emotionally and financially exhausting. Parents fight school bureaucracies for special education services.

It&#39;s from Vintage and by John Pilger.</p><p>John Pilger has been a war correspondent, author, and Academy Award-winning filmmaker. He has twice been named Britain&#39;s Journalist of the Year (the highest award for journalism) and his many other honors include a United Nations Association Media Peace Prize. He lives in London.Award-winning British journalist Pilger, author of A Secret Country: The Hidden Australia (1992), looks again for the truth behind Orwellian officialdom in Great Britain, the US, South Africa, Indonesia, and, most notably, Burma. Pilger makes a clear and disturbing case that US management of the media in the Gulf War covered up one-quarter of a million deaths, most of them civilian. And the reader may well follow his claims, US protests to the contrary, that the subsequent embargo kept food out of the mouths of children and medicine from the sick. But to go light on his criticism of Saddam Hussein or to claim that Israel is nothing but a US client state that has committed more acts of terrorism that any other Middle East entity seems like old Soviet propaganda, rather than truth. Pilger is, in fact, fervently anticapitalist in the manner of an old-style Soviet apparatchik. Thus, one cannot entirely trust his critique of big media such as CNN and the various enterprises of Rupert Murdoch, though such criticism is gratifying and long overdue. Pilger strikes home the most convincingly when he takes on British arms merchants, and he does so by sticking to numbers and actual quotations from officials. He's at his most passionate in his two chapters on modern Burma, writing about a railroad and an oil pipeline being built with slave labor, even with child labor. One would hardly expect Pilger to say kind things about Burma's generals, and he documents the collusion of multinational companies in the exploitation of Burma, but even here one senses that a fine reporter has veered into pamphleteering. A brave and badly needed corrective that itself seems untrustworthy at times but manages to point out the lies behind slick official policy and criticize the media that sell them, even so. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

These panentheists affirm a radical indwelling of God within the world and the world within God. During the same period scientists have begun to abandon the reductionist ideology that characterized much of the modern period. Reductionism is being replaced by a new emphasis on emergence: the study of how new structures and entities arise throughout the evolutionary process and how each requires its own&gt;form of explanation. <br>Surprisingly few theologians have recognized the paradigm shift represented by the convergence of these two important schools of thought. Clayton's pioneering work develops new models of God and the God-world relation in light of panentheism and emergent complexity and models an open-minded Christian theology that still respects tradition.</p><p>Philip Clayton is Ingraham Professor of Theology at Claremont School of Theology and Professor of Religion and Philosophy at Claremont Graduate University.</p><h2>Essays in Kant&#39;s Aesthetics</h2><p>Book by Ted Guyer, Paul (Eds) Cohen</p><p></p><h2>Outrage</h2><p>Light wear to cover.

He didn&#x2019;t want to set off too early &#x2013; someone might notice him hanging around in a half-empty bar and he wanted to avoid that. The most import ant thing was to melt into the crowd, to go unnoticed, to be like everyone else. He mustn&#x2019;t be memorable in any way, must not stand out. In the unlikely event that anyone asked him about his movements that evening, he would say he had been at home all night, watching TV. If everything went according to plan, no one, anywhere, would remember his presence.<br>&nbsp;<br>When the time was right he drained his glass and left. He was slightly tipsy. He walked from his home near the city centre through the autumn darkness towards the bar. The town was already buzzing with weekend revellers. Queues were forming at the most popular venues, bouncers were flexing their muscles and people were wheedling for admission. Music could be heard in the street, and food smells from restaurants mingled with the alcoholic fumes seeping from the bars. Some people were drunker than others. He despised them.<br>&nbsp;<br>He had only a short wait before he made it inside. It wasn&#x2019;t one of the most fashionable places, but it was crammed all the same. That was fine. He had already been on the lookout for girls or young women on his way through town: preferably not much over thirty, preferably not stone-cold sober. It was all right if they&#x2019;d had a bit to drink but he didn&#x2019;t want them too drunk.<br>&nbsp;<br>He kept a low profile. He patted his jacket pocket once more, to be sure he had it. He had touched the pocket lightly several times on the way, knowing that he must be one of those neurotic types who were forever checking whether they&#x2019;d locked the door, forgotten their keys, whether the coffee maker was definitely switched off or a hotplate had been left on. He was obsessive like that &#x2013; he recalled reading about it in some magazine. Another article had been about a different compulsion of his: washing his hands twenty times a day.<br>&nbsp;<br>Most people were drinking half-litres of beer, so he ordered the same. The bartender hardly glanced at him, and he took care to pay cash. He found it easy to blend in. Most of the customers were about his age, out with friends or colleagues. The drinkers raised their voices to be heard over the heavy rap beat of the music and the din was deafening. He took a leisurely look around, observing groups of women sitting and standing together. Other women were with boyfriends or husbands, but there was no one who appeared to be alone. He left without finishing his drink.<br>&nbsp;<br>At the third place he spotted a woman he recognised &#x2013; he thought she was probably about thirty and she seemed to be on her own. She sat at a table in the smoking area, surrounded by other smokers, but she was clearly not with them. He observed her from a distance as she sipped a margarita and smoked two cigarettes. The bar was packed, but no one who approached her seemed to know her. Two men spoke to her but she shook her head and they left. A third man loomed over her, apparently unwilling to take no for an answer.<br>&nbsp;<br>She was a brunette with a pretty face, a bit heavyset but nicely dressed in a skirt and a short-sleeved T-shirt and with a beautiful shawl around her shoulders. Across the T-shirt the words <i>San Francisco </i>were stencilled, with a little flower growing up out of the letter <i>F</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br>She managed to shake off her persistent suitor, who made an angry remark and left.<br>&nbsp;<br>He gave her time to settle down before he approached her. &#x2018;Have you been there?&#x2019; he asked. The brunette looked up. She couldn&#x2019;t place him.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;To San Francisco?&#x2019; he added, pointing at the shirt. She looked down at her breasts.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Oh, this?&#x2019; she asked.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s a delightful city,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;You should go sometime.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>She looked at him, debating whether to tell him to push off like she&#x2019;d told the others. Then she seemed to remember meeting him before.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;There&#x2019;s so much going on there,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;In Frisco. A lot to see.&#x2019; She smiled.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Fancy meeting you here,&#x2019; she said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Yes, nice to see you. Are you here alone?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Alone? Yes.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;So, what about Frisco? You must go.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;I know, I&#x2019;ve . . .&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>Her words were drowned out by the noise. He passed his hand over his jacket pocket and leaned over her.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&#x2018;The airfare&#x2019;s not cheap,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;But I mean . . . I went there once, it was great. A delightful city.&#x2019; <br>&nbsp;<br>He used certain words deliberately. She was looking up at him, and he imagined her counting on the fingers of one hand how many young men she had met in her life who would use a word like <i>delightful</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;I know. I&#x2019;ve been.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Oh. Well, then. May I join you?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>She hesitated for a moment, then moved over to make room for him.<br>&nbsp;<br>Nobody took any notice of them in the bar, nor when they left a little over an hour later and headed back to his place, taking deserted side streets. By then the drug was working. He had offered her another margarita, and as he&#x2019;d returned from the bar with her third drink he&#x2019;d slid his hand into his jacket pocket to palm the pill and slipped it into her glass. They were getting along fine, and he was sure she would give him no trouble.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Criminal Investigation Department received the notification two days later. El�nborg was on duty and she called out the team. When she arrived at the scene traffic police had already closed off the road, in the Thingholt district, and the forensics officers were just pulling up. She saw a representative of the Regional Medical Officer get out of his car. At the start of a case only forensics team members were permitted to enter the flat, to carry out their investigations. They &#x2018;froze&#x2019; the scene, as they put it.<br>&nbsp;<br>El�nborg made the necessary arrangements as she waited patiently for the forensics team to give her the go-ahead. Journalists and other media reporters were gathering, and she observed them at work. They were pushy &#x2013; some were even rude to the police who were keeping them away from the crime scene. One or two of the TV reporters looked familiar: a vacuous quiz-show host who had recently transferred to the news, and the presenter of a political chat show. She had no idea why he should be down here with the news teams. El�nborg recalled her early days with the CID, when she&#x2019;d been one of only a handful of women detectives: back then the reporters had been much more polite, and far fewer. She preferred the press journalists. Print-media people were less rushed, less overbearing and less self-important than the TV reporters toting their video cameras. Some of them could even write.<br>&nbsp;<br>Neighbours stood at their windows or had stepped out into their doorways, arms crossed in the autumn chill, puzzlement on their faces; they had no idea what had happened. Police officers had started questioning them: had they noticed anything unusual on the street, or specifically at the house, anyone coming or going? Did they know the resident? Had they been inside?<br>&nbsp;<br>El�nborg had once rented a flat in Thingholt, long before it had become fashionable. She had liked living in this historic area on the hillside above the old town centre. The houses, which varied in age, encapsulated a century of the history of building and architecture in the city: some had been humble labourers&#x2019; cottages, others had been grand villas built by wealthy entrepreneurs. Rich and poor, masters and workers, had always lived there in harmony side by side until the district had started to attract young home-buyers with no interest in settling in the sprawling new suburbs that were stretching into the upland heaths, and who preferred to make their homes close to the heart of the city. The artistic and fashionable classes moved into the old timber-framed houses, and the splendid mansions were bought up by the super-wealthy and nouveau riche. They wore their downtown postcode like a badge of honour: <i>101 Reykjav�k</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br>The head of forensics appeared at the corner of the house and called to El�nborg. He reminded her to be careful, and not to touch anything.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s nasty,&#x2019; he said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&#x2018;Oh?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Like an abattoir.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>The entrance to the ground-floor flat was at the rear, facing the garden, and was not visible from the road; a paved path led round to the back of the house. As she entered the flat El�nborg saw the body of a young man lying on the living-room floor. His trousers were around his ankles and he was wearing nothing but a bloodsoaked T-shirt with the words <i>San Francisco </i>stencilled on it. A little flower was growing up out of the letter <i>F</i>.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>My Red Balloon</h2><p><b>Winner of:</b><br>Cooperative Children's Book Center CHOICES Best of the Year<br><br><b>A charming story about the power of friendship</b><br>A little girl begins a happy bus outing with her beautiful red balloon.

She boards the large yellow bus, and off they go. At the next stop, she proudly shows her balloon to the new passenger, Bear, but panics when it blows away. The bus continues on its route following the balloon. At each stop, another animal boards to help with the search. Rabbit, Penguin, Elephant, and Giraffe direct the driver until at last they catch up with the errant balloon. Just as the trailing string is within their grasp, a passing bird pops the balloon.

The United States and other Western governments have even tapped into these trends, using hip hop and Sufi music to de-radicalize Muslim youth abroad. Aidi situates these developments in a broader historical context, tracing longstanding connections between Islam and African-American music. Thoroughly researched, beautifully written, <i>Rebel Music</i> takes the pulse of a revolutionary soundtrack that spans the globe.<br></p></p><p><p>Hisham D.

The annual event is organized by Tools of War, a grassroots arts organization that invites artists from across the country and Europe to perform in the Bronx, hip-hop&#x2019;s putative birthplace, and to meet some of the genre&#x2019;s pioneers, figures like Afrika Bambaataa and Kurtis Blow. I arrived at the park and asked around for Christie Z, a local promoter and activist. Christie, who has blue eyes and a ruddy complexion and wears a white head scarf, is the founder of Tools of War and a smaller group called Muslims in Hip Hop. She is married to Jorge Pab�n (aka Fabel), a well-known dancer and master of ceremonies (MC), who appeared in the classic 1980s hip-hop film <i>Beat Street</i> and currently teaches &#x201c;poppin&#x2019; &#x201d; and &#x201c;lockin&#x2019; &#x201d; dance styles at NYU. The two&#x2014;Christie Z &amp; Fabel, as they&#x2019;re known&#x2014;are a power couple on the East Coast&#x2019;s hip-hop scene, but they&#x2019;ve become significant players internationally as well, organizing shows in Europe and bringing artists from overseas to perform in America.<br>&nbsp;<br>Christie&#x2019;s story is unusual. &#x201c;People always ask me,&#x201d; she says with a laugh, &#x201c;how did a white girl from central Pennsylvania become a Muslim named Aziza who organizes turntable battles in the Bronx? I say the lyrics brought me here. I was in high school when I heard &#x2018;The Message,&#x2019; &#x201d; she says, referring to the 1982 breakout song by Grandmaster Flash, which vividly described life in the ghetto during the Reagan era, and was one of hip-hop&#x2019;s earliest mainstream hits. &#x201c;I heard that track and I followed the sound to New York.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I had arrived early hoping for a pre-show interview with the French rap crew 3�me &#x152;il (Third Eye), who had flown in from Marseille to perform that evening. The rap trio is known in France for its socially conscious lyrics. Since the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, the group had become even more political, rapping about what they call the West&#x2019;s &#x201c;stranglehold&#x201d; on the East. I stood around the stage waiting. A circle had formed with a group of boys clapping and dancing, as the DJ on duty that evening&#x2014;another pioneer, DJ Tony Tone of the Cold Crush Brothers&#x2014;spun rap and Latin soul classics. Soon Third Eye&#x2019;s manager, Claudine, a brown-haired woman in her early twenties, appeared and led me backstage. I explained that I was a researcher at Columbia writing about global hip-hop. Her face lit up. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been wanting to talk to you for a while,&#x201d; she said, as she walked me through a backstage tent and out into the open. Later I found out Claudine had thought I was a representative of Columbia Records, about to offer her group a contract.<br>&nbsp;<br>The sun was setting, a blue glow had enveloped the park, and I walked up to the four young men lounging on a bench facing the spectacular Indian Lake, which sits at the park&#x2019;s center. Soon I was chatting with the rappers&#x2014;Boss One (Mohammed) and Jo Popo (Mohammed), both born in the Comoros Islands off the coast of East Africa, but raised in Marseille&#x2014;and their DJ, Rebel (Moustapha). They were dressed similarly in sagging denim Bermudas, eighties-style Nike high-tops, and baseball caps. Jo Popo gave me a copy of their new hit single, &#x201c;Si Triste&#x201d; (So Sad). I told him I&#x2019;d already seen bootlegged copies at African music stands in Harlem. He nodded and gave me a fist bump. The song, popular among West African youth in New York, offers social commentary over a looping bass line, decrying police brutality and mass incarceration (with a special shout-out to the American death-row prisoner Mumia Abu-Jamal). I asked them how the French press responded to their lyrics, and about the anti-immigrant National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen&#x2019;s claim that hip-hop was a dangerous musical genre that originated in the casbahs of Algeria.<br>&nbsp;<br>Boss One shook his head, &#x201c;For Le Pen, everything bad&#x2014;rap, crime, AIDS&#x2014;comes from Algeria or Islam.&#x201d; This was mid-2003; the War on Terror was in its early years. &#x201c;The more Bush and Chirac attack Islam and say it&#x2019;s bad,&#x201d; said Boss One, &#x201c;the more young people will think it&#x2019;s good, and the more the oppressed will go to Islam and radical preachers.&#x201d; His tone became a little defensive when talking about the <i>banlieues,</i> the poor suburbs that ring France&#x2019;s major cities, stating that life in France&#x2019;s <i>cit�s </i>was better than in the American ghettos. &#x201c;Life is hard in France, but we have a social safety net. Here there is no such thing&#x201d;&#x2014;he stood up to emphasize the point&#x2014;&#x201c;and it will get worse with Bush, the cowboy, <i>le rancheur!</i>&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Their bluster disappeared when I asked what they thought of the Bronx. They grew wistful talking about the Mecca of hip-hop. Jo Popo smiled describing their meeting the day before with hip-hop legend Afrika Bambaataa. &#x201c;<i>C&#x2019;�tait incroyable!</i>&#x201d; Bam, as he is known, is particularly loved in France, where he was instrumental in introducing hip-hop in the early 1980s. The group&#x2019;s music mixer, DJ Rebel, who previously hadn&#x2019;t said a word, suddenly spoke up. &#x201c;I have dreamed of visiting the Bronx for all thirty-six years of my life. This is where hip-hop started, this music which has liberated us, which has saved us,&#x201d; he said with apparent seriousness. &#x201c;Yesterday we met Bambaataa and Kool Herc. I thanked them personally for what they have done for us blacks and Muslims in France&#x2014;they gave us a language, a culture, a community.&#x201d; His voice broke a little.<br>&nbsp;<br>I was struck by the emotion and sincerity of their words, and I had a few academic questions to ask: Why was the Bronx so central to the &#x201c;moral geography&#x201d; of working-class kids in Marseille? Where did this romantic view of the American ghetto come from? Why were they more fascinated by Bronx and Harlem folklore than by the culture of their parents&#x2019; countries of origin? Claudine suddenly reappeared and asked them to return to the tent. Grandmaster Flash, the legendary DJ and another iconic figure of global hip-hop, had arrived, and they were scheduled to meet him. &#x201c;Flash invented scratching&#x2014;I get paid to teach scratching in France,&#x201d; said DJ Rebel getting up to leave. &#x201c;<i>A bient�t,</i>&#x201d; and the rap trio and their thoughtful DJ walked off. Half an hour later they were on the stage, waving their arms: &#x201c;<i>Sautez! Sautez! Sautez!</i>&#x201d; Boss One translated: &#x201c;That means, &#x2018;Jump! Jump! Jump!&#x2019; &#x201d;</p></p><h2>Tales from India</h2><p><b>Discover a world of classic tales from India.</b><br><br>Come on a journey with renowned storyteller Jamila Gavin as she writes of great floods, legendary romances, and epic battles between good and evil. This new collection of Hindu tales, including the birth of the gods, tales of creation, and the arrival of humans, is illuminated by Amanda Hall's exquisite artwork, which reflects the influence of both classical and contemporary Indian art.</p><p>Jamila Gavin was born in Mussoorie, India, in the foothills of the Himalayas, to an Indian father and an English mother. Jamila has written many books with multicultural themes for children and young adults. She won the Whitbread Children&#x2019;s Book Award in 2000 and was runner-up for the Guardian Children&#x2019;s Fiction Prize. Her work has been adapted for stage and television. Jamila Gavin lives in England.<br><br>Amanda Hall studied art and illustration at the Cambridge School of Art. Inspired by cultures from all over the world, she has illustrated many books for children including Robi Dobi: The Marvellous Adventures of an Indian Elephant by Madhur Jaffrey. Amanda Hall lives in the U.K.Rooted in Hindu written and oral tradition, this collection of fine stories taken together creates an intriguing cultural monograph but are also intriguing told individually on their own. Tales about the creation of the world from a lotus flower; a great flood that impelled the first man, Manu, to build his ark; and the birth of Lord Krishna from a clash of good and evil are all included. Gavin&#x2019;s narratives are deliberate yet spellbinding, and Hall&#x2019;s artwork is visual storytelling at its best, with illustrations that literally glow with the mystique and beauty of India. To students with a more Western perspective, some of the stories will seem strange or even scary, though most any reader will notice some marked similarities between the stories presented in this book and many common epics from the Judeo-Christian tradition. This handsome book of Hindu mythology is a fine choice for most any library collection.

The author of the highly acclaimed biographies Emily Dickinson and Samuel Richardson and the Eighteenth-century Puritan Character, she holds the 1922 Professorship of the Humanities at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She is an honorary Board Member of &#39;&#39;The Mount,&#39;&#39; The Edith Wharton Restoration Foundation in Lenox, Masachusetts.Great art, like ripe fruit, can only come from a fully mature tree. One that is stunted will only bring forth stunted fruit. Cynthia Griffin Wolff traces the process by which Edith Wharton emerged from such a troubled life to literary triumph. Repressed from her youth, Wharton does battle with the monsters that haunt first the young artist, then the mature woman, to become fully both in the end. Fields&#39;s powerful reading is richly seductive and melodic, but careful as well: She deftly shifts intonation slightly between Wharton and Wolff so that the reader never confuses the two. In the end, she reads a satisfying and scholarly portrait of the woman as artist. P.E.F.

Whichever choice she makes, she knows she will lose someone she loves.<strong> </strong></p><p><b>Nancy Grossman</b> works for the Honors Program at DePaul University in Chicago, where she teaches courses in creative writing and young adult fiction. She lives in a Chicago suburb with her family. <i>A World Away</i> is her debut novel.Gr 9 Up-In this coming-of-age story with a cultural twist, Eliza, 16, yearns to break free of the constraints and predictability of her plain life as an Amish teen in Iowa. There are wonderful people in her life-loving parents, best friends, and Daniel, who would like to be more than a friend. Still, a restless energy drives her to see and know something different. For her rumspringa (an Amish teen's chance to explore the outside world), Eliza is able to convince her parents to allow her to work as a nanny outside Chicago. She sees modern conveniences such as electricity, cell phones, and computers for the first time and experiences putting on makeup and worrying about what to wear. She soon meets Josh, who appreciates that she is not a cookie-cutter personality like other girls. Although he is a conscientious young man, he arranges for them to attend a party where they both drink too much. Eliza becomes ill and in his rush to get her home, Josh drives into a garage door. Both teens accept that they made mistakes and pay for the damages. Surprises about Eliza's family and her perpetual state of wonder at the unfamiliar world she has landed in keep the story moving forward. Eliza learns about an aunt she never knew she had and her mother's own experience on her rumspringa. Ultimately, she reflects on what she has seen and who she misses and comes to the decision to return to her community.

Called the Shelley of Yiddish, he was characterized as being &#34;drunk with talent.&#34; This book-the first full-length anthology of Manger&#39;s work-displays the full range of his genius in poetry, fiction, and criticism. The book begins with an extensive historical, biographical, and literary-critical introduction to Manger&#39;s work. There are then excerpts from a novel, The Book of Paradise, three short stories, autobiographical essays, critical essays, and finally, Manger&#39;s magnificent poetry-ballads, bible poems, personal lyrics, and the Megilla Songs. These works, which have the patina of myths acquired ages ago, also offer modern psychological insight and irrepressible humor. With Manger we make the leap into the Jewish twentieth century, as he recreates the past in all its layered expressiveness and interprets it with modernist sensibilities.</p><p>"Manger's deceptively folkish style, which mixes fantasy and autobiography, Biblical plots and a fin-de-si�cle East European setting, pathos and parody, angels' wings and social protest, the lyric and dramatic, has been brilliantly rendered into English by Leonard Wolf."&#x2014;Ruth R.

Michael Morgan was not ready to die, but his funeral was carried out just the same. Trapped in the dark limbo between life and death as a ghost, he searches for an escape. Instead, he discovers the beautiful Laura...and a love stronger than the boundaries of the grave and the spirit world.</p><p>Conversing in a mausoleum with the dead, an eccentric recluse is tugged back into the world by a pair of ghostly lovers bearing an extraordinary gift--the final chance for his own happiness. When challenged by a faithless wife and aided by a talking raven, the lives of the living and the dead may be renewed by courage and passion, but only if not belatedly. Told with an elegiac wisdom, this delightful tale of magic and otherworldly love is a timeless work of fantasy imbued with hope and wonder. After multiple printings since 1960, this newest edition will contain the author's recent revisions and will stand as the definitive version of an ageless classic. <p> <strong>Questions for Peter S. Beagle</strong> </p><p> <strong>Jeff VanderMeer for Amazon.com:</strong> When you were writing <i>A Fine and Private Place</i>, did you have any idea it was going to have such staying power? </p><p> <strong>Beagle:</strong> No. Not at all, of course. When I was 19 years old I never thought in terms of classics or being permanently around. I'd known enough writers, even at that age, to see that what happens to your work is so far out of your control you simply can't afford to let that kind of concern enter your thinking. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> The publisher asked you to remove four chapters from the book. At the time, did you agree with the decision? Have your feelings about it changed over the years? </p><p> <strong>Beagle:</strong> At the time I was outraged. I fought every step of the way, and every sentence. Today I'm inordinately grateful to Marshall Best, the editor who did that. Marshall is long gone, so I just hope that back then I had sense and courtesy enough to say thank you. But I don't think I realized fully what his effect on the book had been until many years later. If it weren&#x2019;t for him I don&#x2019;t think the book would still be in print. He's also the one who came up with the title and the allusion to those marvelously appropriate lines from Andrew Marvell's "To His Coy Mistress"--I'd originally called the book <i>The Dark City</i>, after the way that Jonathan Rebeck saw the graveyard. Titles, sad to say, have never been my strong suit. Most of my best have actually come from friends or editors. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> To what extent are any of the characters in <i>A Fine and Private Place</i> autobiographical? I ask because the detail work in the novel, especially with regard to older people, seems so fresh and free of cliche. </p><p> <strong>Beagle:</strong> I think that <i>A Fine and Private Place</i> is very nearly, though not quite, my first attempt to capture the voices in the Bronx neighborhood where I grew up. Nobody is based on any one person, but there&#x2019;s a piece here and a piece there was useful. I hung fire on creating Laura Durant, when it came time to bring her into the story, until I decided to base her physically--not emotionally, but physically--on a Pittsburgh actress I was in a play with. I just didn't know enough young women in those days. And there are scenes in there which people from the old neighborhood would recognize--when Mrs. Klapper goes into the Wireman's grocery, that is very much the little store on the corner across from my house. Yet even there I mixed things up. I think what keeps the book fresh isn't the fantasy, but the fact that I was trying very hard to make it real. To make the voices real. In the end it is always the voices, for me. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Your books have, over the years, resonated with readers everywhere. Have reader reactions or opinions changed the way you think of the books? </p><p> <strong>Beagle:</strong> Only in the sense that they sometimes make me go back and look at them. When you do this writing thing day by day, you don't do a lot of reflecting on your own relationship to the old work. What does get me, though, is just how much the books have actually influenced the real lives of real people in ways I couldn't imagine. That&#x2019;s enormously touching for me. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> One of my favorite moments in your fiction is when the true Medieval infringes on the fake Medieval in <i>The Folk of the Air</i>. You manage to convey a real sense of the alien perspective--a sense that if we were to travel back in time, we might find our ancestors as hard to understand as we would creatures from outer space. Did you research your way into that moment and that effect, or...? </p><p> <strong>Beagle:</strong> I've thought about it a lot, having read a great deal of history (my father was a history teacher). And there are fiction writers out there who are so good at bringing the literal stink of a certain period into your nostrils as you read...well, for me they are intimidating, because there are novels I'd like to write based on certain historical events that I'm just not sure I could. In the case of <i>The Folk of the Air</i> I did a lot of research, from many angles, because the real group that my imaginary one was based on didn't limit itself to a narrow span of time, but rather built characters and personas out of events as far back as the Viking era and as recent as 1650. And the history as presented in their gatherings wasn't necessarily the most accurate. So on the one hand I was trying to go for a certain sense of the real, when it does come, in contrast to some fanciful, semi-informed imaginings. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> What are you currently working on--and where should we look for your short fiction in the next year or so? </p><p> <strong>Beagle:</strong> In terms of short fiction, I've got a chapbook coming out from Dreamhaven Books early in 2008 called <i>Strange Roads</i>, with three stories inspired by the art of Lisa Snellings-Clark. There are also six or eight pieces of short fiction appearing in various original fantasy anthologies, magazines, and fiction websites, and I'm working on a quartet of season-themed stories that will premiere not in print, but as podcasts. That last set is for a wonderful little website called The Green Man Review. They did a whole special issue about me and also named me their official Oak King this year, so it's the least I could do. In terms of book-length work, 2008 is going to be absolutely crazy with original books and reprints. Just crazy. There are a couple of new novels finally coming out, a manga-style graphic adaptation of <i>The Last Unicorn</i>, several new collections, and at least two nonfiction books. I can hardly keep track of it all myself, so the best way for anyone to stay up to date would be to visit my website or Conlan Press, or just sign up for my free email newsletter, <i>The Raven</i>. Whatever else I might think about being 68, the simple fact is that I'm busier than ever. It's like George Burns used to say: "I can't die--I'm booked!" </p>Peter S. Beagle is the best-selling author of <i>The Last Unicorn</i>, which has sold a reported five million copies since its initial publication in 1968. His other novels include <i>A Fine &amp; Private Place</i>, <i>The Innkeeper&#x2019;s Song</i>, and <i>Tamsin</i>. His short fiction has been collected in four volumes by Tachyon Publications, including <i>The Rhinoceros Who Quoted Nietzsche</i>, <i>The Line Between</i>, <i>We Never Talk About My Brother</i>, and <i>Sleight of Hand</i>. He has won the Hugo, Nebula, Mythopoeic, and Grand Prix de l&#x2019;Imaginaire awards as well as the World Fantasy Award for Lifetime Achievement.</p><h2>The Tainted Coin (Chronicles of Hugh de Singleton, Surgeon)</h2><p><p>It is the autumn of 1367.

Each week, Fratelli Fresh feeds between 15-20,000 people across its Sydney-based food empire. Alla Fratelli is all about seasonal, fresh, heart-warming, delicious eating, dedicated to flavour and tradition - but it rips up the rule book at the same time, challenging some of the older Italian traditions and putting meals together that suit the way we live now. This is how we should all be cooking at home, with fresh, beautiful, simple, generous, messy Mediterranean market food, shared with children, parents, friends and neighbours.</p><p>Barry McDonald is the man behind the Fratelli Fresh household name. His story, his food and his recipes will be written up by Terry Durack. What&#39;s the style, the voice, the presence - it&#39;s Italian with attitude. It&#39;s the magic of Fratelli Fresh, the freshness, the seasonality, the sense that you are in the moment and of the place. Casual, cheerful, generous, hospitable, a little bit cheeky. And WC perhaps a little nostalgic for the good old traditions of Italian food/culture.</p><h2>Looking for Peyton Place: A Novel</h2><p>A picture-perfect New Hampshire town hides a history of scandal and intrigue -- a legacy Annie Barnes has never shaken since growing up in tiny Middle River. Five decades ago the area was rocked by a bombshell of a book, <i>Peyton Place,</i> and its author, Grace Metalious, who seemed to know everyone's most intimate secrets. Now a bestselling novelist herself, Annie has come home to find answers to the strange circumstances of her mother's recent death, which leads her to uncover a shocking truth about the local paper mill. The townspeople fear Annie intends to pen a <i>Peyton Place</i> of her very own, and no one wants her stirring up trouble. But one intriguing man is captivated by Annie's determined spirit -- and he wants to give the people of Middle River something to talk about....</p><p>Barbara Delinsky has written more than twenty <i>New York Times </i>bestselling novels, with over thirty million copies in print.

Visit her at BarbaraDelinsky.com.Middle River might be the town Grace Metalious had in mind when she wrote PEYTON PLACE. Its residents think so. When Annie Barnes returns there to investigate the cause of her mother's early death, the town and its secrets turn on her. The production has two readers. Richard Ferrone reads well but does not make a memorable impression of his character. His portrayal offers neither romance nor mystery. Julia Gibson is the one who stays in the mind because of her delivery of the story's first-person narration. It is her voice that one remembers in thinking back on the book.

The book is not just for graphic designers, but also for anyone who is curious about how we live today. Looking through an atlas has always been a fascinating way to explore the world. Around the World is a contemporary evolution of an atlas tailored to our information age that takes its readers around the globe in 288 pages. In this book, compelling information graphics illustrate how natural and manmade phenomena impact our lives. They take us on an entertaining and informative journey that gives us a deeper understanding not only of our planet&#x2019;s geography, but also of the key local and global developments of the twenty-first century. Alongside classic facts about nature, history, population, culture, and politics, Around the World&#x2019;s eye-catching information graphics clearly explain complex processes such as global trade and evolving demographics. The book gives added insight into our modern world through its visual exploration of topics such as the changing speed of travel. Around the World alternates between providing information on general subjects such as families, languages, life expectancies, natural disasters, eating habits, economies, prosperity gaps, or religions, and providing more specific details about hobbies, coffee consumption, overfishing, soccer, and internet providers. The book also depicts events that have left indelible marks on our collective conscience including September 11, the Olympic Games, Japan&#x2019;s Fukushima disaster, and the sinking of the Titanic. Like any atlas, Around the World cannot claim to be a complete record. Rather, it serves as a rich cornucopia of information about local peculiarities of global relevance that bring home the little differences &#x2015;as well as the astoundingly large similarities&#x2015;among the citizens of the world.

Jimmy's tone was cheerful, but ,I didn't miss the message.</p><p>"We've brought each other some comfort there, these last few years." I chose my words carefully and kept my voice light.</p><p>The silence on the line built.</p><p>I could picture Jimmy in his hotel room in Los Angeles. Tall and lanky. In Levi's and a sports shirt. He would be draped casually over an easy chair, a book open on the coffee table. His face is long and lanky, too, with that deadpan quality that often fools those he interviews into thinking him placid, perhaps a tad obtuse. It wasn't a mistake they'd make twice.</p><p>Jimmy likes gourmet meals, art museums, small. towns, and parties where people know each other.</p><p>No wonder he felt lonely,</p><p>Los Angeles is a sprawl of broken dreams and lost opportunities, disconnected souls and entertainment junkies. The sunny skies and graceful palms don't redeem jammed roadways to nowhere.</p><p>But it wasn't simply that he was in L.A. on a book tour.</p><p>"Henrie 0." Jimmy's voice is a pleasant tenor. A nice voice. A nice man. An old friend. A sometime lover. "Henrie 0, I've been looking at a house in Cuernavaca. You'd like it." Eagerness ran the words together. "I've been wanting to tell you about it. I'm going down there next week. I want you to come with me."</p><p>He paused.</p><p>Suddenly, I knew what was coming. And I was totally unprepared.</p><p>Since we'd both been widowed and become reacquainted, we'd taken a number of holidays together. And enjoyed them and each other. But "Henrie 0, I want to build a life there. With you. As my wife."</p><p>"Jimmy..." I didn't know what, to say. I'd not. thought about where we were going. I'd not actually ,thought we were going anywhere. I'd seen our occasional meetings-Acapulco, New York. Paris, Charlotte Amalie -- as interludes: sensual, satisfying, self-contained; a lovely enhancement but not a basic component of my life.</p><p>Yet I've never seen myself as an opportunist. Certainly not in connection with people for whom I have great respect and liking. I'd just never figured Jimmy Lennox into the equation of my life. At least not on a permanent basis.</p><p>"Think about it, Henrie 0." The words were still casual, but his voice grew huskier. "We'd have fun. You know that."</p><p>"I know that." But there is a world of difference between occasional liaisons and a permanent commitment.</p><p>"I'll be here until a week from Friday."</p><p>And that was all. I was left holding a buzzing, line.</p><p>As I walked briskly across the campus, I saw it with a more thoughtful gaze. This had been a beating place for me, after Richard's death. We are none of us ever prepared for the loss of a beloved partner. When the loss comes without warning, the devastation is complete.</p><p>Richard's last call had ended, "I'll be home Monday. Love you, sweetheart."</p><p>But when Monday came, Richard, my surefooted, athletic, graceful Richard was dead from a fall down a rugged cliff. He came home from the island paradise of Kauai in a coffin.</p><p>One day I'd been Mrs. Richard Collins. The next I was a widow, a widow remembering how bitterly she'd grudged his island visit.</p><p>Nothing softens that kind of loss.</p><p>The common wisdom urges no changes for a year. I'd stayed in our Washington apartment, but the joy was gone.</p><p>Millay's verse was a refrain in my heart:</p><p>Oh, there will pass with your great passing Little of beauty not your own. Only the light from common water. Only the grace from simple stone!</p><p>Richard and I, had freelanced for a number of years. We'd taken assignments where and when we wanted, as long as we could work together. Without Richard, none of it mattered. It was months later when a good friend who taught journalism called on me to take over her classes while she recuperated from a broken hip.</p><p>So I'd come to the little town of Derry Hills, Missouri, to Thorndyke University, and joined an unusual faculty made up primarily of retired professionals.</p><p>That was, four years ago.</p><p>Now Derry Hills was home, or as close to home as a wanderer would ever know. Tborndyke was a thriving, prosperous school. I liked the weathered limestone and ivy-laden brick buildings, the curving paths among towering oaks and sycamores, the old redbrick bell tower.</p><p>Most of all, I enjoyed seeing students, young, old, scruffy, well-dressed, smiling, scowling, but all of them purposeful; going somewhere fast. It might be to a class or the mailroom or for a beer, but they were racing ahead. And whether they knew, it or not-and many of them did they were starting the lives they would one day lead, building the habits of success or failure, happiness or despair.</p><p>I relished being a part of that. I enjoyed this hilly, wooded Missouri terrain, the misty curtains of fog in autumn, the crunch of snow underfoot in winter, the gentle greening in spring. I found each season invigorating, especially winter. But, I always move swiftly, no matter the season, a woman in a huffy though the days of huffy are past.</p><p>It wasn't simply the beauty of the campus that pleased me, though it was spectacular now as the November leaves blazed. In some ways, I was like in old dog luxuriating in a sunny spot, drawing strength from the vitality that surrounded me. An almost seismic sense of expectation emanates from a college campus.

For more than three decades as a physician and medical researcher, he has studied the experience of low back pain in people who are otherwise healthy. Hadler terms the low back pain that everyone suffers at one time or another "regional back pain." In this book, he addresses the history and treatment of the ailment with the healthy skepticism that has become his trademark, taking the "Hadlerian" approach to backaches and the backache treatment industry in order to separate the helpful from the hype.<br><br>Basing his critique on an analysis of the most current medical literature as well as his clinical experience, Hadler argues that regional back pain is overly medicalized by doctors, surgeons, and alternative therapists who purvey various treatment regimens. Furthermore, he observes, the design of workers' compensation, disability insurance, and other "health" schemes actually thwarts getting well. For the past half century, says Hadler, back pain and back pain-related disability have exacted a huge toll, in terms of pain, suffering, and financial cost. <i>Stabbed in the Back</i> addresses this issue at multiple levels: as a human predicament, a profound social problem, a medical question, and a vexing public policy challenge. Ultimately, Hadler's insights illustrate how the state of the science can and should inform the art and practice of medicine as well as public policy. <i>Stabbed in the Back</i> will arm any reader with the insights necessary to make informed decisions when confronting the next episode of low back pain.<br><br></p><p>"Nortin Hadler exposes the overmanagement of a sometimes-contrived disease with a compelling body of scientific investigation."--Mehmet Oz, M.D., New York Presbyterian Hospital, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University <br>For more than three decades as a physician and medical researcher, Nortin Hadler has studied the experience of low back pain in people who are otherwise healthy.

Condensed in one hundred and ninety-six aphorisms, or sutra-s, are the essential philosophy and technique of Yoga. Over the centuries, scholars and teachers of Yoga have attempted to expand these sutra-s with commentaries and explanations.

His personal style emphasized harmony between buildings and their surroundings and featured strong, elemental shapes, the experimental use of new materials, and simple, open floor plans. In 1912 Griffin won an international competition with his design for the proposed new Australian capital city of Canberra. His subsequent travels to oversee development of that design eventually led to Griffin's decision to settle permanently in Australia.<br>Walter Burley Griffin in America combines the richly detailed photographs of Mati Maldre and extensive research of Paul Kruty to provide the first complete visual record ever published of Griffin's surviving American work.</p><p>Mati Maldre is a professor of photography in the Chicago State University art department.One of the most original architects America has produced, Walter Burley Griffin worked in the shadow of his early colleague and employer, Frank Lloyd Wright.

Now, 40 years after sports history was made, acclaimed sports writer Mike Freeman celebrates the Dolphins&#x2019; singular achievement in <em>Undefeated</em>. A riveting story filled with heartbreaking injuries, miraculous finishes, and tested relationships&#x2014;featuring a roster of gridiron greats, including Bob Griese, Earl Morrall, Larry Csonka, Paul Warfield, Mercury Morris, Nick Buoniconti and others&#x2014;<em>Undefeated</em> follows a underdog team on its remarkable run: 14 regular season victories, 2 postseason wins, and a Super Bowl championship. It is a book no football fan will want to miss.&nbsp; <br></p></p><p><p>Each year, every football team sets out to play a perfect season. Only one has ever succeeded talk about beating the odds.</p><p>The Miami Dolphins of the late 1960s were a laughingstock, an expansion team, and a franchise where careers went to die. Then came Coach Don Shula. In just a few short years&#x2014;through hard work, long practices, and his no-nonsense attitude toward the game&#x2014;Shula transformed the team into a championship franchise. The Dolphins were by and large unseasoned players or rejects from other teams. Even so, they made it to Super Bowl VI. They suffered a humiliating loss to the Dallas Cowboys, becoming the first team in Super Bowl history not to score a single touchdown. But Shula closed the 1971 season by telling his players to remember this loss and make sure nothing like it ever happened again. And they listened.</p><p>The Miami team came back for the 1972 season determined to be winners this time, not losers. Through his tough-as-nails coaching, grueling preseason training, and inspiring message of redemption, Shula took the Dolphins, one game at a time, to their legendary Super Bowl victory. Led by such greats as Larry Csonka, Bob Griese, Nick Buoniconti, Larry Little, Mercury Morris, and Jake Scott&#x2014;as well as players discarded from other franchises who were transformed into key contributors once they were indoctrinated into Shula's system&#x2014;the team was undefeated 17-0 in the regular season and went on to win Super Bowl VII, in one of the greatest stories of toughness, perseverance, and skill the National Football League has ever seen.</p><p>Along the way, the Dolphins became the team of the 1970s, with Miami as a fascinating backdrop. The city emerged as an anti&#x2013;Fidel Castro hub and morphed into the city made notorious on the television show <em>Miami Vice</em>. The cocaine began to flow as the Dolphins rose to prominence, and the team struggled with its own drug issues. Yet the Dolphins established themselves as one of the city's most trusted entities. While the city faced racially charged riots, Shula purposely built an integrated locker room in an NFL&#x2014;and a city&#x2014;that were still extremely hostile to blacks.</p><p>Based on years of research and interviews, <em>Undefeated</em>, by award-winning journalist and author Mike Freeman, examines what is perhaps the single greatest accomplishment in team sports history: the unforgettable NFL season in which the Dolphins didn't lose a single game. There has never been a football team like those Miami Dolphins, and there may never be again.</p><p>Mike Freeman is an NFL Insider for CBSSports.com.

He is an accomplished poet whose writing has appeared in <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>, <i>The Paris Review</i>, <i>The New Republic, Books &amp; Culture, and Image</i>. He was recently named a Guggenheim Fellow. </p>As a former Baptist who passed through the Presbyterian and Episcopal churches on his way to the Orthodox Church, Cairns, a poet and professor of literature and creative writing at the University of Missouri, offers readers a unique and often compelling perspective on life as a pilgrim on Mount Athos, Orthodoxy's holy mountain. Recounting three visits to the mystical bastion of male monasticism and another trip to an Orthodox monastery in Arizona, Cairns writes transparently of his struggles to grow in the life of prayer as he searches, mostly in vain, for a spiritual father who can help him. His accounts of traveling to the various monasteries on Mount Athos are earthy and blessedly not saccharine, yet beautifully accented with descriptions of times when he was particularly moved by an experience of worship. Especially touching is his narrative of the pilgrimage he makes with his son, Benjamin, who affords a fresh perspective on all that his father has previously seen and related. Cairns includes several of his poems, which serve as well-placed enhancements to the text. His open attitude in explaining matters of faith makes this book suitable for a broad audience of readers on spiritual journeys. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Beasley, M.D. is a board-certified clinical physician, who was also certified by examination in 1986 as a specialist in Addiction Medicine as defined by the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM). During the past twenty years he has lead both inpatient and outpatient bio-behavioral treatment teams who have been responsible for the inpatient and outpatient diagnosis and treatment of more than twenty thousand patients with chemical dependency and/or acute psychiatric conditions. He has also served as a professor and department head at Harvard and Tulane Universities, Dean of the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at Tulane University, Chairman of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and as a member of the National Commission on Population Growth and the American Future. <p>Currently Dr. Beasley is directing a non-profit international internet project concerning with providing the latest scientific information on Alcoholism and Chemical Dependency prevention and treatment to both professionals and lay people. He is preparing the fourth edition of Diagnosing and Managing Chemical Dependency, a book for professionals and lay people in the addiction fields which will be published both in text form and on the internet in the year 2001. He serves as a consultant advisor to many private and non-profit organizations. He continues his studies and consultation activities in family planning, nutrition, and the organization and design of health delivery systems.</p>An argument for a systems-approach to health that looks at ``the full spectrum of ills that are afflicting our planet, from the destruction of the seas and rain forests to the compromising of the human immune system.'' Beasley is director of Bard College Center's Institute of Health Policy and Practice. A distillation of a hefty 300,000-word Kellogg Foundation report (1989) on some ten years of Beasley's research, the result is a readable text that nevertheless still often overwhelms with disturbing data on the state of our planet and our species. Beasley examines the factors whose interaction largely determines our health: genetics, environment, nutrition--and lifestyle, which includes level of stress, physical activity, psychological attitudes, chemical dependencies, sexual behavior, exposure to violence, and patterns of sleeping, eating, and working. He then takes a critical look at the limitations of modern medicine's symptom/disease-oriented approach to illness, recommending instead a return to a more broad-based ``naturalistic'' approach to health, in which medical schools would provide sophisticated training in nutrition, environmental impacts, toxicology, addictions, and counseling of patients in order to prevent disease, not simply to diagnose and treat it. Beasley concludes with recommendations that individuals take certain steps to ensure good health--eliminating or reducing harmful habits, becoming knowledgeable about self-care, avoiding toxic substances in the environment, and improving nutrition. A disheartening look at the hazards to health we all face, and an urgent appeal to the medical community--and to the individual--to take action to deal with this sea of troubles. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

This elegantly presented double-hardback slipcased set is available for a limited time only. The perfect gift for any book lover. &#39;Wolf Hall&#39; and &#39;Bring Up the Bodies&#39;, both winners of The Man Booker Prize, in 2009 and 2012 respectively, are the first two instalments in Hilary Mantel&#39;s Tudor trilogy. They have gathered readers and praise in equal and enormous measure. They have been credited with elevating historical fiction to new heights and animating a period of history many thought too well known to be made fresh. Through the eyes and ears of Thomas Cromwell, the books&#39; narrative prism, we are shown Tudor England, the court of King Henry VIII. Cromwell is a wholly original man: the son of a brutal blacksmith, a political genius, a briber, a charmer, a bully, a man with a delicate and deadly expertise in manipulating people and events. In &#39;Wolf Hall&#39; we witness Cromwell&#39;s rise, beginning as clerk to Cardinal Wolsey, Henry&#39;s chief advisor, charged with securing the divorce the pope refuses to grant. He is soon to become his successor. By 1535, when the action of &#39;Bring Up the Bodies&#39; begins, Cromwell is Chief Minister to Henry, his fortunes having risen with those of Anne Boleyn, Henry&#39;s second wife. Anne&#39;s days, though, are marked. Cromwell watches as the king falls in love with silent, plain Jane Seymour, sensing what Henry&#39;s affection will mean for his queen, for England, and for himself.</p><p>Hilary Mantel is the author of thirteen books , including A PLACE OF GREATER SAFETY, BEYOND BLACK, and the memoir GIVING UP THE GHOST.

Dunne asks his readers to engage in a number of exercises aimed at allowing them to discover for themselves what the character of moral judgment really is and the ways in which their own consciousness of moral judgment can be used as the foundation for moral theories and categories. Using this method one learns how to evaluate and critique moral theories of the past, present and future, as well as how to engage in fruitful dialog and collaboration on matters of ethics and morality.</p><p></p><h2>The Last Coyote/Trunk Music (Harry Bosch)</h2><p>WITH HEART-STOPPING THRILLS, UNEXPECTED TWISTS, AND ELECTRIFYING ACTION ON EVERY PAGE, IT&#39;S EASY TO STAY UP ALL NIGHT AND FINISH A THRILLER BY NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING AND EDGAR AWARD-WINNING AUTHOR MICHAEL CONNELLY.

But the reality of the time was that everyday people witnessed thousands of little moments blaze into an epic conflict-for more than twenty years. Now, for the first time, experience the sparks of revolution the way the colonists did&#x2014;in their very own town newspapers and broadsheets.<em> Reporting the Revolutionary War</em> is a stunning collection of primary sources, sprinkled with modern analysis from 37 historians. Featuring Patriot and Loyalist eyewitness accounts from newspapers printed on both sides of the Atlantic, readers will experience the revolution as it happened with the same immediacy and uncertainty of the colonists.<br><br>The American newspapers of the eighteenth century fanned the flames of rebellion, igniting the ideas of patriotism and liberty among average citizens who had never before been so strongly united. Within the papers, you'll also read the private correspondence and battlefield letters of the rebels and patriots who grabbed the attention of each and every colonist and pushed them to fight for freedom and change.

Todd Andrlik is vice president of marketing and PR at one of the nation&#39;s largest commercial construction firms.<p><b>Introduction</b></p> <p><strong>T</strong>here are no photographs of the American Revolution. No snapshots exist to show ordinary life or depict the struggles and suffering of the late eighteenth century. Engravings and oil paintings, made long after the war ended, portray epic battles and heroism but often fail to realistically capture the moment.</p> <p> Newspapers are the closest thing we have to photos of the Revolution. They transport readers back in time, providing unmatched insight about common life and life-altering events. Despite their small size and lack of headlines, eighteenth-century newspapers pack an intense, concentrated punch and demonstrate the incredible power of the printed word. Through newspapers, we realize that history is much more than a chronological list of battles as we eavesdrop on everyday life and witness everyday realities of the American Revolution through the eyes of the British and the American colonists. The eighteenth-century newspapers presented in this book help us see that history is real life, messy, and exciting. We learn firsthand what many historians claim: without newspapers, there would have been no American Revolution.</p> <p> Through vivid eyewitness accounts, battlefield letters, and breaking news compiled from hundreds of newspapers-primarily printed from 1763 to 1783 on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean-this story of the American Revolution is unlike any version that has been told. It is raw and uncut, full of intense action, drama, and suspense. From start to finish, these frontline newspapers deliver incomparable insight about America's founding. As a collection, they provide one of the most reliable and comprehensive narratives of the Revolutionary Era, loaded with amazing characters, better-than-fiction plot twists, and the perfect climax. Before these famous and infamous events became the history and foundation of America, they were littered among the news of the day for colonial Americans. Mark Twain wrote "of the wide difference in interest between 'news' and 'history'; that news is history in its first and best form, its vivid and fascinating form; and that history is the pale and tranquil reflection of it."</p> <p> <em>Reporting the Revolutionary War</em> brings to life precious first drafts of history and lets readers experience the charming rusticity of eighteenth-century newsprint, complete with stains, tears, imperfect ink and paper, typesetting mistakes, misspellings, and grammatical errors that were all typical of the era. Reading Revolution Era newspapers in their original form helps reproduce the same immediacy and uncertainty felt by those who first held them.</p> <p> With each newspaper, readers gain valuable insight into the social, economic, political, and military histories of the American Revolution. Reading newspapers in their entirety-including advertisements, obituaries, and essays-provides more than a glimpse of all the obstacles and ideas of the period. It creates a 360-degree view of the American Revolution and the formation of the United States.</p> <p> Another important history lesson to be gained from this book relates to journalism. We live in a time of instant and on-demand news. Journalists and bloggers work frantically around the clock, competing to break news stories before anyone else. Cable news channels and websites stream updated headlines nonstop across their screens. Using Twitter and Facebook, millions of citizen reporters scramble to share the latest news affecting their lives, practically in real time. Despite the debated endangerment of printed newspapers, it is difficult to imagine a time when media were more important. However, 250 years ago, newspapers were the fundamental form of mass media and were more important than in any other time in America's history.</p> <p> Just as social media helped ignite and organize the Arab Spring revolutions of the Middle East and Northern Africa, colonial newspapers fanned the flames of rebellion, provided critical intercolonial communication during the war, sustained loyalty to the Patriot cause, and aided in the outcome of the war-all of which becomes evident after reading straight from the pages of newspapers. In <em>Reporting the Revolutionary War</em>, readers will see that Americans maintained "Liberty or Death! Join or Die!" attitudes with blood, as well as ink, on their hands. David Ramsay, who twice served as a delegate in the Continental Congress, wrote that "in establishing American independence, the pen and the press had merit equal to that of the sword."</p> <p> Not only do eighteenth-century newspapers contain the exclusive essays, reports, and advertisements of the day, but they also include reprinted extracts from other primary sources such as private letters, journal entries, official government documents, and war-zone intelligence direct from merchants, travelers, soldiers, officers, and common colonists. They are a proverbial gold mine of information. Since the day the Revolutionary War ended, historians and authors have relied heavily on newspapers as the basis for their own analysis and interpretations of the course of the war. The endnotes of practically every history book about the Revolution are loaded with references to the up-close-and-personal perspectives found in newspapers.</p> <p> <em>Reporting the Revolutionary War</em> brings to life eighteenth-century newspapers in a firsthand account of America's founding, distinct from the history we receive in high school and university texts. Never before has such a significant collection of American Revolution newspapers been made available to the general public in such color and detail. Never before has access to such an archive been made so easy. And never before has this version of the American Revolution been told.</p></p><h2>Poker Wisdom of a Champion</h2><p>Learn what it takes to be a great poker player by climbing inside the mind of poker's most famous champion.&nbsp; Fascinating anecdotes and adventures from Doyle's early career playing poker in roadhouses are interspersed with lessons from the champion who has made more money at poker than anyone else in history.&nbsp; Learn what makes a great player tick, how he approaches the game, and receive candid, powerful advice from the legend himself.&nbsp; 208 pages</p><p>Originally published in 1984 under the title According to Doyle, this collection by a World Series Poker champion is longer on anecdotes than it is on advice. Doyle won the World Series of Poker twice in the 1970s and his first book, Doyle Brunson's Super System, has become one of the classic strategy books in the game. This volume, however, is made up of short, moralizing stories culled from the experiences of his long playing career. Each story ends with a bit of advice, such as "don't play your cards, play your people" and "when a man's got something heavy on his mind besides poker, he's got no business playing." Beginning players will certainly find such tips useful, but serious poker players interested in concrete suggestions would be better of with the author's first volume. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In this "quintessential utopia," as Lewis Mumford calls it, Wells "sums up and clarifies the utopias of the past, and brings them into contact with the world of the present." The Bison Books edition, with an introduction by Mark R. Hillegas, associate professor of English at Southern Illinois University, brings back into print a work that has stimulated three generations of thinkers.</p></p><p>Often called the father of science fiction, British author Herbert George (H. G.) Wells literary works are notable for being some of the first titles of the science fiction genre, and include such famed titles as The Time Machine, The War of the Worlds, The Island of Doctor Moreau, and The Invisible Man. Despite being fixedly associated with science fiction, Wells wrote extensively in other genres and on many subjects, including history, society and politics, and was heavily influenced by Darwinism. His first book, Anticipations of the Reaction of Mechanical and Scientific Progress Upon Human Life and Thought, offered predictions about what technology and society would look like in the year 2000, many of which have proven accurate. Wells went on to pen over fifty novels, numerous non-fiction books, and dozens of short stories. His legacy has had an overwhelming influence on science fiction, popular culture, and even on technological and scientific innovation. Wells died in 1946 at the age of 79.</p><h2>Chinese Acupuncture and Moxibustion (Library of Traditional Chinese Medicine: Chinese/English edition)</h2><p>Specific Discussions of Meridians and Acupoints, Manipulating Methods and Discussions of Treatment.</p><p></p><h2>Yankee Doodle Dixie: A Novel (Dixie Series)</h2><p><p><i>A charmingly funny testament to second chances in life and love from the acclaimed author of </i>Whistlin' Dixie in a Nor'easter <br><br>Lisa Patton won the hearts of readers last year, her book <i>Whistlin' Dixie in a Nor'easter </i>became a sleeper-success.

It also doesn&#x2019;t take a pretty girl with pigtails and a pooch named Toto to tell you that there is absolutely, positively, no place like home.</p><p>Just thinking about wizards and terriers makes me wish I were Dorothy&#x2014;sleepily opening my eyes to Auntie Em placing a cold rag on my forehead. In my case it would be Kissie sitting at my bedside with a jumbo cold compress. &#x201c;Wake up, baby,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d say. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve just had a bad bad dream.&#x201d;</p><p>It was a dream all right, it just wasn&#x2019;t mine.</p><p>Fourteen months and a mound of heartache later, my compass is pointing south again, and my speedometer is creeping toward eighty. Despite having three unlikely Vermont comrades helping me to find the road back, an old German wicked witch named Helga hindered that road, making it rockier than the Appalachian Trail not twenty miles from the front door of my Vermont inn. Not only did she swindle me out of both my business and my marriage, she despised my own terrier&#x2014;a small, helpless Yorkie by the name of Princess Grace Kelly. Gracie couldn&#x2019;t stand Helga, either; probably one of the reasons her little heart finally pooped out. Even though she&#x2019;s forever buried up in the freezing cold North, I&#x2019;ve got the cross from her grave sitting right here on the passenger&#x2019;s seat next to me on our way back home.</p><p>I can see home in the distance. The parallelogram of Tennessee on the welcome sign slowly emerges the closer I get. The February sun is setting to the right of it and as I roll over the state line my heart rate seems to slow down. A calm washes over me like a warm shot of Grand Marnier, sliding down my throat and coating my insides. It&#x2019;s been over a year since I&#x2019;ve been home and I wouldn&#x2019;t doubt it if I&#x2019;ve given myself early high blood pressure.</p><p>We&#x2019;ve been driving for three days&#x2014;my two little girls and me&#x2014;1,473 miles due south. Sarah and Isabella are in the backseat and I steal another peek at them in my rearview mirror. Their little heads are resting against the sides of their car seats, the monotony of the boundless pavement finally lulling them to sleep. For the first time all day it&#x2019;s quiet.</p><p>Since leaving Vermont, in one heck of a nor&#x2019;easter I might add, I&#x2019;ve paid equal attention to the traffic and my heartstrings. It is a wonder we haven&#x2019;t rear-ended anyone, and an even bigger one that my sultry grin isn&#x2019;t yet a permanent fixture on my face. Between New York and Pennsylvania all I&#x2019;ve thought about is the man who stole my heart&#x2014;and who, only hours ago, sealed our months of longing with a not-so-chaste kiss in George Clark&#x2019;s gas station parking lot. Peter Owen saved my restaurant and my pride when my husband left me for a blond bombshell with a face and bosoms only money could&#x2014;and did&#x2014;buy. Helga is the one responsible for their meeting, just one of the many &#x201c;wicked witch&#x201d; maneuvers she employed as part of her nasty scheme to repossess our inn.</p><p>The rest stops between Pennsylvania and Virginia were punctuation marks in my romantic recollecting. A stream of consciousness brewed in my mind: when Peter and I danced to Van Morrison&#x2019;s &#x201c;Into the Mystic,&#x201d; the first time I tasted his white chocolate mousse, and the moment in the kitchen after my inn&#x2019;s grand opening when we both knew the sparks flying weren&#x2019;t just from the faulty stove.</p><p>And now, in Tennessee, some seventy-two hours have passed but I&#x2019;m reduced to schoolgirl antics, playing our sole kiss over and over in my mind. I&#x2019;ve run that kiss through my head, every minute detail, a thousand times already. How he tasted, how his lips felt against mine, the way his tongue moved slowly around my mouth, and how my heart swirled and danced under his touch. I suppose I&#x2019;ll have to live on that memory until the first time he comes to town. Memphis in May, perhaps? That&#x2019;s the perfect time of year. He&#x2019;ll arrive for the Beale Street Music Festival and stay for the whole month. After all, May means Mud Season back in Vermont. And Mud Season, or &#x201c;The Thaw&#x201d; as the Vermonters call it, means there won&#x2019;t be any work for him there. Heck, the whole state practically shuts down during that time.</p><p>Springtime in Memphis, however, is glorious. We&#x2019;ll go to the Memphis in May Barbecue Festival and the Sunset Symphony together. We&#x2019;ll watch the ducks walk the red carpet at the Peabody Hotel and we&#x2019;ll hang out with Virginia and John, Mary Jule and Al, Alice and Richard, and we&#x2019;ll&nbsp;... the girls will die when I show up unannounced. I cannot wait to see the look on Virginia Murphey&#x2019;s face when I pull up in her driveway in oh, about eight more hours. I figure it&#x2019;ll probably be that late by the time my daughters and I go to a drive-through for dinner and take at least three more tee-tee breaks. She and John will be sound asleep but I&#x2019;ll call her cell and she&#x2019;ll answer anyway. It won&#x2019;t be the first time I&#x2019;ve dialed her at one in the morning.</p><p>Of course Alice, the bossiest of the three, will wonder why in the world I didn&#x2019;t come to her house. Mary Jule might be disappointed, too, but she would never question any decision I make. It&#x2019;s hard having to choose between three best friends. The only reason I&#x2019;m driving to Virginia&#x2019;s house is because, well, honestly, she knows me the best. You can&#x2019;t room with someone all four years of college, and every summer in between, and not know everything there is to know about each other. Virginia knows that I wax my bikini line, and I know about the few little hairs that grow around her nipples and how she sometimes lets them grow too long and forgets to shave them. Modesty goes out the window when you&#x2019;re living with someone you&#x2019;ve known since the age of five.</p><p>Alice and Mary Jule know plenty of my secrets, too, but there&#x2019;s just something about Virginia that soothes me. She&#x2019;s got a calming effect on my soul. Perhaps that&#x2019;s because she&#x2019;s never one time judged me about anything, or maybe it&#x2019;s just as plain and simple as the fact that we&#x2019;ve never been interested in the same man. Our types are completely opposite. She likes more of a girl&#x2019;s guy and I&#x2019;ve always been attracted to the guy&#x2019;s guy. John is perfectly happy to shop with her all day long. He&#x2019;s also the type to wear a Lily tie or lime-green shorts. I prefer the rugged look. I&#x2019;ll take a man who wears a Henley shirt over an argyle sweater, any day of the week.</p><p>Virgy&#x2014;that&#x2019;s what I call her&#x2014;and I just flat-out love one another. To this day, we&#x2019;ve never been in a single fight. Actually, that&#x2019;s not quite true. The closest Virginia has come to scolding me in our twenty-nine-year friendship was when I let my husband talk me into moving to Vermont in the first place. And now, truth be told, she had every right.</p><p>I got the idea from Mama. She had always told me that being a good wife meant following your husband. She claimed she didn&#x2019;t really want to move to Memphis, either, away from Greenwood, Mississippi, but she did it because it&#x2019;s what Daddy wanted her to do. &#x201c;It would have been one thing,&#x201d; she used to say, &#x201c;to move to Jackson. Several of my best friends from Ole Miss lived there.&#x201d; Kissie told me that she had once overheard a phone conversation between Mama and one of her friends. Said my grandfather told Daddy that he&#x2019;d teach him to be a great farmer if he&#x2019;d just dig his heels into the Mississippi Delta and not move to Memphis. He told Daddy that all the cotton land stretched out as far as the eye could see could be his, if he&#x2019;d just lay his roots down in Mississippi and leave Mama right where she belonged, in her own hometown. Like me, Mama was an only child.</p><p>But Daddy&#x2019;s roots couldn&#x2019;t be planted in the middle of a cotton field. Daddy told him, &#x201c;Mr. Grov&#x2019;a, I appreciate the off&#x2019;a, but I don&#x2019;t need your cotton fields. I&#x2019;ve got a cotton family business waiting on me two hours naw&#x2019;th of here and I won&#x2019;t have to get dirt under my finga&#x2019;nails. I&#x2019;ll buy your cotton and won&#x2019;t ever have to break a sweat.&#x201d; Daddy wasn&#x2019;t the farmer type. He&#x2019;d rather work out of his old warehouse on Front Street, or Cotton Row as they call it, right in the middle of all the buying and selling.</p><p>I was raised in a stand-by-your-man household, and I also happened to fall head-over-heels in love with a football quarterback I first saw in the tenth grade. Even though my red-and-blue cheerleading skirt barely covered my backside, Baker Satterfield never looked my way, all because my chest was flat. That all changed, though, the summer before my senior year. When I ran out onto the football field that fall, pom-poms raised high above my head, my bosoms had blossomed into a natural size D, almost overnight. That man took notice of me then, and after swapping class rings, numerous road trips from Ole Miss to UT, horrendous long-distance telephone bills, and a proposal that would make even Scarlett O&#x2019;Hara swoon, we finally tied the knot a couple of years after we both graduated from college. We had, at least at first, what I would call a wonderful marriage: two beautiful daughters, a gorgeous home in Memphis, lifelong friends, great sex, and a social life that involved peach daiquiris and other succulent activities. So when my true love told me of his lifelong desire to open an inn in Vermont&#x2014;well, I had to follow my man.</p><p>Turns out my man followed something of his own and left our barely opened B&amp;B, our girls, and our dog, not to mention our dream life, in my (then) manicured hands.

In it, she describes the three major decisions of her life: not to marry, to be an artist&#x201d; and to listen to her own voices.&#x201d; She speaks of her parents who belonged to a generation before their own&#x201d; and how they instilled in her a sense of guilt, locking her in the prison of her self, a prison constructed with the material of doubt and failure; of shattered dreams and unhappy loves, jealousy, hate, envy and the deadly sins of lovelessness and indifference,&#x201d; but she also tells how she escapes from this prison with the knowledge that her inner sun takes its energy from love, from creativity.&#x201d;<br><i>Lily Briscoe: A Self-Portrait</i> is a book about the exercise of the will, the art of dreaming and the transcendent power of friendship.

Called "one of the best reference books of the year" by Library Journal and named an outstanding academic book of the year by the American Library Association, this is the first book to cover comprehensively the careers of all African Americans who played with a team of major-league quality or whose careers are featured in the history of America&#x2019;s Pastime. It delivers a wealth of information, from vital statistics and the standard baseball figures of batting averages and pitching records to career data, including years of active play, positions played, team affiliations, and even nicknames. To create this one-of-a-kind reference, baseball authority James A. Riley traveled the country to interview the surviving members of the Negro Leagues about their exploits and the careers of their now-deceased teammates. With this invaluable firsthand information, Riley brings to life the careers of such greats as Satchel Paige, Ray Dandridge, Josh Gibson, and Leon Day. Looking past Jackie Robinson&#x2019;s breaking of the color barrier in 1947, he profiles all Major League Hall of Fame players who also played in the Negro Leagues such as Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, Ernie Banks, and Roy Campanella. &#x201c;A landmark publication in the fields of baseball history and African-American history ... a one-of-a-kind work.&#x201d;&#x2014;Booklist</p><p>This is a landmark publication in the fields of baseball history and African American history. It documents more than 4,000 players on Negro League teams from 1872 through 1950. According to the publisher, this is the first book to comprehensively cover the careers of all African Americans who played with a team of major-league quality or whose careers had some historical significance. It includes all major-league Hall of Fame players who also played in the Negro League.<p>The author traversed the country, interviewing men who played in the Negro Leagues about their baseball exploits and the careers of their now-deceased teammates. Information was also gathered by analyzing archival resources for contemporary accounts of games and by viewing microfilm reels of black newspapers. Entries include player name and nicknames, media names, etc.; vital statistics, such as height and weight, birth and death dates; and career information, including years of active play, positions played, teams of which the player was a member. Standard baseball statistical data, such as batting averages and pitching records, are given in the body of the text. The length of entries ranges from 20-word footnotelike entries to a 2,000-word essay on the great pitcher Satchel Paige.</p><p>Entries include delightful anecdotal material as well. For instance, the entry for pitcher Luis Tiant (father of the 1970s Red Sox pitcher of the same name) notes his wily moves and deceptive screwball with which he held Babe Ruth to a single in a double-header. Other entries chronicle the careers of players generally unknown to the public, many of whom were some of the best men to ever play the game. Such is the case of perhaps the most versatile player, Martin Dihigo, who played virtually every position of the infield (including pitcher) and outfield for 22 years (1923-45) in the Negro League and in Latin America. One year in Mexico he led the league in hitting with a .387 batting average and also in pitching with a 18-2 record and .097 ERA.</p><p>Not all entries are biographical: there are many entries on Negro League teams. An appendix provides a bibliography of books, periodicals, newspapers, and special collections and a list of players interviewed. Three inserts of photographs of players are included.</p><p><i>The Biographical Encyclopedia of the Negro Baseball Leagues</i> is a one-of-a-kind work that all public libraries should acquire. <i></i></p>Editor Riley is an accomplished writer and a recognized authority on the Negro leagues, having published numerous books on the subject (e.g., Too Dark for the Hall , T.K.

Notable Hall of Famers included are Hank Aaron, Satchel Paige, Ernie Banks, and Jackie Robinson. Arranged alphabetically, the citations contain a variety of biographical and statistical information.

On the outskirts of Fresno, California, Vernon Coy raises fighting cocks and lives on the earnings of two hard-working hookers--his wife Paula, and Curly, his older brother Weldon&#39;s ladyfriend. Curly is living with Vern and Paula while Weldon finishes a long stretch in Soledad for armed robbery. Weldon is an expert at &#34;working the corners,&#34; maintaining prison relationships to minimize violence. One of his allies reveals that Vernon&#39;s name has been placed &#34;in the hat,&#34; meaning that a tough prison gang called the Dirty White Boys has put out a contract on him as a suspected snitch. How the Coy brothers and their resourceful women defend themselves, aided by a memorable old con called The Stepper, is the meat of Martin&#39;s dementedly logical story.Dianne Martin is a writer, editor, writing consultant and an adjunct instructor at Butler University.

Lewis, Madeline L&#39;Engle, Elia Young, and others</p><p>Grade 4-8 Within this enticing collection is material enough to bring sighs of satisfaction from confirmed unicorn lovers and make converts of skeptical newcomers. The author of Sarah's Unicorn (Lippincott, 1979) pulls together a wide variety of stories and poems which deal in one way or another with unicorns, introducing them with his own concise history of unicorn lore. This history acknowledges the elusive nature of the myth as well as the beast, and the choices that Coville has made reflect a varied approach to the legend. In the creations of Madeleine L'Engle, C. S. Lewis, Jane Yolen, Myra Cohn Livingston, and others, readers meet unicorns who are old and feeble, sleek and arrogant, demanding or giving. Unlike Michael Green in his elegant De Historia et Veritate Unicornis (Running Pr, 1983), which is consistantly medieval, Hildebrandt has used a wide variety of media and unicorn images to evoke feelings consistent with the stories. This book does exactly what anthologies should do. It satisfies on its own while leading readers irresistably to the longer works of its writers.

The longest poem, 'On Earth,' is a transcription of mind passing from life into death, in the form of an abecedary, modeled on ancient gnostic hymns. Other poems in the book, especially 'Nocturne' and 'Blue Hour,' are lyric recoveries of the act of remembering, though the objects of memory seem to us vivid and irretrievable, the rage to summon and cling at once fierce and distracted.</p><p></p><blockquote>"The voice we hear in <em>Blue Hour</em> is a voice both very young and very old. It belongs to someone who has seen everything and who strives imperfectly, desperately, to be equal to what she has seen. The hunger to know is matched here by a desire to be new, totally without cynicism, open to the shocks of experience as if perpetually for the first time, though unillusioned, wise beyond any possible taint of a false or assumed innocence."<p></p><p>-- Robert Boyers</p></blockquote><p></p></p><p><p>Carolyn Forch� is the author of <em>Gathering the Tribes,</em> winner of the Yale Younger Poets Award; <em>The Country Between Us,</em> which received awards from the Academy of American Poets and the Poetry Society of America; and <em>The Angel of History,</em> awarded the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> Book Award. She is also the editor of the anthology <em>Against Forgetting: Twentieth-Centuly Poetry of Witness.</em> Recently she was presented with the Edita and Ira Morris Hiroshima Foundation Award for Peace and Culture in Stockholm. She lives in Maryland with her husband and son.</p>In addition to winning acclaim for her 1994 collection The Angel of History, Forch&#x201a; has been active as an anthologist (Against Forgetting: Twentieth Century Poetry of Witness) and translator of Georg Trakl, Claribel Alegria and, most recently, Mahmoud Darwish (Unfortunately, It Was Paradise), among others. The title of this fourth collection, her first since Angel, translates the French phrase for pre-dawn light into a state of mind that turns everything into a hypnopompic dream or bardic state. Forch&#x201a;'s speaker's memories (of childhood, of nursing her son in Paris) are intermingled with ethereal images of 20th century horror, and dosed with a mysticism derived from Heidegger and Buber. This puts her squarely in the territory of visionary abstraction Michael Palmer and Jorie Graham have been mining; like them, Forch&#x201a; is willing to let the contradictions of this technique speak for themselves. "In the Exclusion Zones," for example, is lovely and mysterious in its brevity, but is revealed in the endnotes to refer to the contaminated earth around Chernobyl. The book's tour de force, "On Earth," orders arrhythmic fragments alphabetically over 47 pages in the manner of "gnostic abecedarians," and foregrounds its lyric complications more concretely: "more ominous than any oblivion/ mortar smoke mistaken for an orchard of flowering pears." The poems' success ultimately rests in the reader's tolerance for gestures aimed at sensuality and sensibility in the face of atrocity, though the 10 or so shorter poems that precede "On Earth" are more modest in their ambitions, arousing and sating the longing for beauty with fewer attendant complications. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Book of Fairy &amp; Folk Tales of Ireland</h2><p>The Book of Fairy &amp; Folk Tales of Ireland [hardcover] Yeats, W.

A whole generation is reinventing itself as it moves away from the role of earner toward the new status of &#x201c;engaged and interested citizen, retired.&#x201d;<br> <br>As we gradually find our footing, we&#x2019;re also trying to find a way of paying for it. None of us knows how many years we have ahead&#x2014;20? 30? More? Last year, my family celebrated my mother&#x2019;s 100th birthday. (She&#x2019;s sharp and happy, thank you for asking!)<br> <br>Centenarians are rare but our lengthening life expectancies continue to surprise us all. On average, you&#x2019;ll reach your mid- to late-80s. The 90-plus population has tripled over the past three decades. We have every reason to worry that our money will run out before we do. Many of us are staying on the job well past traditional retirement age, not just because we like the work but because we need our salaries, too.<br> <br>The way you look at your finances changes as you move from preretirement to your postretirement years. While you&#x2019;re still working, you focus on accumulating a satisfactory pile. You might have a dollar target in mind. More likely, you&#x2019;re saving whatever you can, aiming every year for &#x201c;more.&#x201d; You&#x2019;re paying down debt (I hope) and focusing on investments that can make your money grow.<br> <br>That flips when you enter retirement&#x2019;s door. Suddenly, you have to take the money you&#x2019;ve saved and turn it into a reliable income for life. How large will that income be?<br> <br>In a perfect world, you&#x2019;ll work on this question well before you leave your job. The answer will tell you when (and whether) you can afford to quit. In this imperfect world, however, you might be pushed into retirement unexpectedly. You&#x2019;ll need to figure out, pronto, how to manage with what you already have. Modest spenders can live on Social Security and, if they&#x2019;re lucky, a pension, dividends, and interest. You might pick up some extra income from a temporary or part-time job.<br> <br>Often, however, that&#x2019;s not enough to pay the bills. You&#x2019;ll have to supplement your income with regular withdrawals from your savings and investments. These withdrawals amount to &#x201c;homemade paychecks,&#x201d; landing in your bank account just the way your working paychecks did. If you&#x2019;re married, the paychecks have to cover the cost of two life spans as well as any emergency need for cash. What kind of standard of living can you afford? Will you have to keep working? And how do you stretch your savings to make the money last?<br> <br>When I started asking those questions for myself, I looked around for information. There isn&#x2019;t much. I found books and websites on how to invest but practically nothing on how to prudently parcel your money out. If you take too little from savings, you&#x2019;re depriving yourself of some of the comforts that you worked for. If you take too much, you&#x2019;ll go broke.<br> <br>I did find plenty of bad advice from financial firms and their salespeople (a.k.a. &#x201c;advisers,&#x201d; &#x201c;financial consultants,&#x201d; and brokerage firm &#x201c;vice presidents&#x201d;). I was shocked when I looked at the menu of so-called &#x201c;safe&#x201d; and &#x201c;guaranteed&#x201d; investments we&#x2019;re being offered. They&#x2019;re loaded with hidden costs and risks. Maybe the firms are unscrupulous, maybe just careless. Either way, people like us&#x2014;with savings that we need to both hoard and spend&#x2014;are walking around with targets on our backs. We&#x2019;re where the money is and, believe me, they&#x2019;re coming for it, or trying to.<br> <br>Fortunately, important and objective research is currently being done on ways of creating reliable incomes for life. I&#x2019;ve spoken to the key players and gathered their findings here. What surprised me&#x2014;really surprised me&#x2014;is how simple a retirement income plan can be. So simple that you can manage the investments and withdrawals yourself. If you&#x2019;d rather not, I found several new sources of high-level help at rock-bottom costs. You don&#x2019;t have to pay big commissions and fees to get good advice.<br> <br>I also learned a lot by talking with practically everyone I met about the retirement decisions they&#x2019;re making for themselves. Often, they were leaving money on the table because they hadn&#x2019;t heard about their alternatives. Social Security topped this list. I found people taking it at age 62&#x2014;not because they had to but because it was there. They had no idea how much their monthly benefit would increase if they waited a few years to collect. If you&#x2019;re married and each of you has a Social Security account, you can combine your benefits or adjust your claiming dates to collect even more.<br> <br>Then there&#x2019;s the question of what percentage of your retirement savings to put into stocks (or, rather, stock-owning mutual funds&#x2014;the best bet for you and me). Some savers were so spooked by the near collapse of the financial system in 2007 and 2008 that they now invest only in bonds and insured certificates of deposit. But even if you can live on today&#x2019;s low fixed-interest rates, what will that income be worth in purchasing power as the years go by?<br> <br>There&#x2019;s a lot of research linking the percentage you hold in stocks to the size of the sustainable income you can withdraw from your savings for life. Having read it, I&#x2019;ve come to think of retirement as being split in half. For the first half&#x2014;the near-term 10 years or so&#x2014;holding safe or low-risk CDs or bond mutual funds makes a lot of sense. You need a reliable source of money in case stock prices decline. But to fund the second half of retirement&#x2014;starting 10 or 12 years from now&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll need to own investments that grow. American and international business, as a whole, has succeeded wonderfully over time (with occasional hiccups). We can share in that growth without breaking a sweat by buying and holding just two or three well-diversified stock-owning mutual funds. When you do this, you&#x2019;ll still be an &#x201c;income investor.&#x201d; Future capital gains create spendable income just as interest and dividends do.<br> <br>For prudent cash withdrawals from your retirement savings, the standard advice has been to take 4 percent of the total in the first year and add an increment for inflation in each subsequent year. But 4 percent is too much if you own only bonds and CDs. And it&#x2019;s perhaps too little when part of your money is invested for growth. You don&#x2019;t have to make a wild guess about how much of your savings you can afford to spend. There are recipes. Who knew?<br> <br>While working on this book I changed my mind about a few things. For example, I developed a new respect for immediate-pay annuities that convert a lump sum of savings into an income for life. They offer a higher monthly income than you can prudently withdraw from investments that you manage yourself. (Don&#x2019;t confuse &#x201c;immediate-pay&#x201d; with the variable annuities that promise lifetime benefits. &#x201c;Lifetime benefit&#x201d; annuities are on my &#x201c;no&#x201d; list due to high costs and misleading sales. It&#x2019;s all explained in Chapter 6.)<br> <br>Another example&#x2014;I learned a new use for reverse mortgages. These loans against home equity are often a poor deal for people in later age, especially for those who have almost run out of cash. But if you take the loan earlier, in the form of a credit line, you can use it to increase the size of your monthly income. The credit line grows every year, which gives you a nice hedge against potential inflation.<br> <br>A homemade paycheck isn&#x2019;t intended to cover everything. You need it only to fill the gap between your retirement expenses and your other sources of income, such as Social Security, pension, rents, part-time work, and whatever. Figuring out that gap is the entryway to retirement planning. Don&#x2019;t feel bad if you have to trim your expenses so as not to take too much from your savings every year. Almost everybody trims whether they confess it or not. Peace of mind is finding a way of life that works.<br> <br>Every personal situation is a little different. Some people focus their plans on retiring at a certain age&#x2014;anywhere from 45 to &#x201c;never.&#x201d; Some get a buyout offer at 55 and wonder whether they can afford to take it. Some are pushed into retirement unexpectedly, through illness or job loss, and find that money is short. Some have retired already and need a clearer look (or a second opinion) on how to handle their money now. I&#x2019;ve ranged over all the major financial questions I can think of, including health and life insurance. Inevitably, products and options will change in the future but, in my reporting, I sought general principles that will stand the test of time.<br> <br>The biggest thing I learned, after digging into this subject for a couple of years, is the significance of our sense of self as we approach or enter this change of life. We need to find a new way of being&#x2014;a fresh identity, different passions and pastimes, and a deeper involvement with family, community, and friends. We&#x2019;re not on the shelf (yet!). We have lots to contribute and the time to find our place. What gives us this freedom of mind and action is having an income that we&#x2019;re sure will last for life. This book was written to help you build it. After that, adventure calls.<br> <br>Jane Bryant Quinn<br> <br>New York City</p><h2>Tajar Tales</h2><p>Three stories about an unusual and mischievous creature that lives in the woods near a summer camp and whose companions are the Range Ranger and a witch</p><p>Jane Shaw Ward entranced children of all ages from the Rocky Mountains to China, from Paris to California, with her unique and delightful Tajar Tales. By popular demand they were written down in the 1920&#39;s and they have delighted more than four generations of children. Miss Ward grew up in Colorado where the Tajar was born in a childrens camp. For two decades, Miss Ward worked in China with the YWCA. She then studied social work in Paris and in Pittsburgh. Before retiring, she was a member of the faculty of the School of Social Work at UCLA. A copy of the very first printing of The Tajar Tales can be found in the UCLA reference library. It was published in 1921 (without illustrations) in Shanghai, China, by Mrs. William Shaw WardGrade 2-4-Some stories do not translate into print with the same grace and verve that they have when told orally. Tajar tales, which originated as spoken tales at a camp and were first published in 1924, fall into that class. They feature a creature said to be "something like a tiger, and something like a jaguar, and something like a badger," who definitely cannot stay out of trouble, plus an old witch and the authority figure, the Range Ranger, a vindictive character who metes out punishments in every chapter. There is a lot of nonsensical double talk that just doesn't work. The characters lack depth, and the plots wander aimlessly, only occasionally stumbling onto something interesting. The watercolor-washed ink illustrations have an old-fashioned quality that is very charming. The pages have plenty of white space, and the overall look is attractive. Tajar appears to be an engaging character. Too bad he doesn't get support from the text to prove it.<br><i>Patricia A.

Elizabeth Gray&#x2019;s translations are informed by her thorough knowledge of Persian and the Persian poetic tradition. (Many recent books attributed to Hafiz have been produced by persons who do not know Persian at all!) This bilingual edition also includes two brilliant studies of Hafiz by Gray and Daryush Shayegan, plus helpful notes to the translation.</p><p>Text: English, Persian (translation)<br> Original Language: Persian"These are truly remarkable and moving translations: the first English versions of Hafiz to read as poetry while still capturing the unique qualities of concision, multivalent meaning and spiritual depth which have for centuries made his Persian ghazals the acknowledged masterpiece and exemplar of poetic art throughout the Eastern Islamic world." -- <i>James Morris, professor of Islamic thought and literature, Oberlin College</i><br><br>"This is a groundbreaking work, one that places the ghazal of Hafiz into a contemporary English poetic idiom. Ms. Gray captures the rhythms, the paradoxes, the ironies, the sudden changes in tone and voice, the ambiguities, the spark and the bite of the original. After too long a wait, we encounter Hafiz, come alive in an English style that is at once natural and intricate. This is a remarkable achievement." -- <i>Michael Sells, professor of Islamic literature and author of <i>Mystical Languages of the Unsaying</i></i><br><br>A translation . . . with a tender and poetic care that is both a scholarly and artistic joy. -- <i>The Harvard Review</i><br><br>These are truly remarkable and moving translations. -- <i>James Morris, author of Wisdom of the Throne</i><br><br>This is a groundbreaking work, one that places the ghazal of Hafiz into a contemporary poetic idiom. -- <i>Michael Sells, author of Early Islamic Mysticism</i><br><br>Western scholars of classical Persian poetry have frequently felt humbled before the grand ocean of allusions and historical references, stock phrases and metaphors, ever-recurring images and figures, tantalizing integration of rhythm and rhyme and world-play and meaning, from all of which leaps forth the ghazal--ghazal, the hard-as rock genre of Persian poetry, of which Hafiz of Shiraz is the unparalleled master. To be sure, the very form of this genre is unique to its own milieu: ghazal is a single poem containing within itself a whole multiplicity of vibrating small poems: for each verse of the ghazal, the bayt, is an integral whole, related to other bayts only--at least apparently--by a meter that is fixed and by a rhyme that reappears. <p>Given all this, translating a Persian ghazal is no easy matter. Steeped in tradition, it requires long curtains of explanatory footnotes hanging from the rod of each translated verse; but how clumsy such an exercise will look! And then, the translator must at once be highly learned in the Persian literary tradition and profoundly skilled in poetic craft. These are the twin requirements for those daring ones who undertake the daunting task. </p><p>Here is an English translation of fifty ghazals of the great Hafiz: a translation with a rich flow that is surprising, with a vigilant faithfulness to the original that is commendable, and with a tender and learned poetic care that is both a scholarly and an artistic joy. Elizabeth Gray presents us with a bouquet of Shirazi flowers, blazing in their colors and so fresh. She is to be admired both for her erudition and her verbal skills. And more, we must admire her also for her cultural courage. </p><p>The plan of this work is very sensible. First, Gray provides a very useful introduction; here she presents the historical setting in which the 14th century poet Hafiz was composing his ghazals; she explicates the nature of this genre itself, including its formal and technical requirements; she speaks of the challenges faced by a translator; and she utters an authoritative word of caution to the reader: "brandish lightly . . . the templates of Western literary criticism" [!] (p. xxi). Yes, we must heed her advice. Then, she juxtaposes the original Persian text and her translation; and her there exist no footnotes, no heavy curtains, no clumsiness. To be sure, notes do exist--but far removed from the translations, at the end of the book. This was an intelligent structural decision. These notes are minimal, not too extensive, not too pedantic. And they are highly beneficial. In some cases, they constitute packed short essays on some of the most abstruse stylistic, conceptual, and historical elements of the Persian poetic tradition. It seems, then, that the work has wide scope: its magnetism would pull scholars, students, and the enthusiasts alike. -- <i>The Harvard Review, Vol. 8, Spring 1995; pp. 81-85</i></p></p><h2>Billy Budd and Other Tales</h2><p>A collection of short stories features the author&#39;s posthumously published novella, Billy Budd, which traces the violent rivalry between a young sailor and a demonic superior, and a new introduction by Joyce Carol Oates. Reprint.</p><p><p><b>Herman Melville</b> was born in August 1, 1819, in New York City, the son of a merchant. Only twelve when his father died bankrupt, young Herman tried work as a bank clerk, as a cabin-boy on a trip to Liverpool, and as an elementary schoolteacher, before shipping in January 1841 on the whaler Acushnet, bound for the Pacific. Deserting ship the following year in the Marquesas, he made his way to Tahiti and Honolulu, returning as ordinary seaman on the frigate United States to Boston, where he was discharged in October 1844. Books based on these adventures won him immediate success. By 1850 he was married, had acquired a farm near Pittsfield, Massachussetts (where he was the impetuous friend and neighbor of Nathaniel Hawthorne), and was hard at work on his masterpiece <b>Moby-Dick.</b></p> <p>Literary success soon faded; his complexity increasingly alienated readers. After a visit to the Holy Land in January 1857, he turned from writing prose fiction to poetry. In 1863, during the Civil War, he moved back to New York City, where from 1866-1885 he was a deputy inspector in the Custom House, and where, in 1891, he died. A draft of a final prose work, <b>Billy Budd, Sailor</b>, was left unfinished and uncollated, packed&nbsp;tidily away by his widow, where it remained until its rediscovery and publication in 1924.</p><p><strong>1</strong><br>In the time before steamships, or then more frequently than now, a stroller along the docks of any considerable seaport would occasionally have his attention arrested by a group of bronzed mariners, man-of-war&#x2019;s men or merchant sailors in holiday attire, ashore on liberty. In certain instances they would flank, or like a bodyguard quite surround, some superior figure of their own class, moving along with them like Aldebaran among the lesser lights of his constellation. That signal object was the &#x2018;Handsome Sailor&#x2019; of the less prosaic time alike of the military and merchant navies. With no perceptible trace of the vainglorious about him, rather with the offhand unaffectedness of natural regality, he seemed to accept the spontaneous homage of his shipmates.<br>A somewhat remarkable instance recurs to me. In Liverpool, now half a century ago, I saw under the shadow of the great dingy street-wall of Prince&#x2019;s Dock (an obstruction long since removed) a common sailor so intensely black that he must needs have been a native African of the unadulterate blood of Ham--a symmetric figure much above the average height. The two ends of a gay silk handkerchief thrown loose about the neck danced upon the displayed ebony of his chest, in his ears were big hoops of gold, and a Highland bonnet with a tartan band set off his shapely head. It was a hot noon in July; and his face, lustrous with perspiration, beamed with barbaric good humor. In jovial sallies right and left, his white teeth flashing into view, he rollicked along, the center of a company of his shipmates. These were made up of such an assortment of tribes and complexions as would have well fitted them to be marched up by Anacharsis Cloots before the bar of the first French Assembly as Representatives of the Human Race. At each spontaneous tribute rendered by the wayfarers to this black pagod of a fellow--the tribute of a pause and stare, and less frequently an exclamation--the motley retinue showed that they took that sort of pride in the evoker of it which the Assyrian priests doubtless showed for their grand sculptured Bull when the faithful prostrated themselves.<br>To return. If in some cases a bit of a nautical Murat in setting forth his person ashore, the Handsome Sailor of the period in question evinced nothing of the dandified Billy-be-Dam, an amusing character all but extinct now, but occasionally to be encountered, and in a form yet more amusing than the original, at the tiller of the boats on the tempestuous Erie Canal or, more likely, vaporing in the groggeries along the towpath. Invariably a proficient in his perilous calling, he was also more or less of a mighty boxer or wrestler. It was strength and beauty. Tales of his prowess were recited. Ashore he was the champion; afloat the spokesman; on every suitable occasion always foremost. Close-reefing topsails in a gale, there he was, astride the weather yardarm-end, foot in the Flemish horse as stirrup, both hands tugging at the earing as at a bridle, in very much the attitude of young Alexander curbing the fiery Bucephalus. A superb figure, tossed up as by the horns of Taurus against the thunderous sky, cheerily hallooing to the strenuous file along the spar.<br>The moral nature was seldom out of keeping with the physical make. Indeed, except as toned by the former, the comeliness and power, always attractive in masculine conjunction, hardly could have drawn the sort of honest homage the Handsome Sailor in some examples received from his less gifted associates.<br>Such a cynosure, at least in aspect, and something such too in nature, though with important variations made apparent as the story proceeds, was welkin-eyed Billy Budd--or Baby Budd, as more familiarly, under circumstances hereafter to be given, he at last came to be called--aged twenty-one, a foretopman of the British fleet toward the close of the last decade of the eighteenth century. It was not very long prior to the time of the narration that follows that he had entered the King&#x2019;s service, having been impressed on the Narrow Seas from a homeward-bound English merchantman into a seventy-four outward bound, H.M.S. <em>Bellipotent</em>; which ship, as was not unusual in those hurried days, having been obliged to put to sea short of her proper complement of men. Plump upon Billy at first sight in the gangway the boarding officer, Lieutenant Ratcliffe, pounced, even before the merchantman&#x2019;s crew was formally mustered on the quarter-deck for his deliberate inspection. And him only he elected. For whether it was because the other men when ranged before him showed to ill advantage after Billy, or whether he had some scruples in view of the merchantman&#x2019;s being rather short-handed, however it might be, the officer contented himself with his first spontaneous choice. To the surprise of the ship&#x2019;s company, though much to the lieutenant&#x2019;s satisfaction, Billy made no demur. But, indeed, any demur would have been as idle as the protest of a goldfinch popped into a cage.<br>Noting this uncomplaining acquiescence, all but cheerful, one might say, the shipmaster turned a surprised glance of silent reproach at the sailor. The shipmaster was one of those worthy mortals found in every vocation, even the humbler ones--the sort of person whom everybody agrees in calling &#x2018;a respectable man.&#x2019; And--nor so strange to report as it may appear to be-though a ploughman of the troubled waters, lifelong contending with the intractable elements, there was nothing this honest soul at heart loved better than simple peace and quiet. For the rest, he was fifty or thereabouts, a little inclined to corpulence, a prepossessing face, unwhiskered, and of an agreeable color--a rather full face, humanely intelligent in expression. On a fair day with a fair wind and all going well, a certain musical chime in his voice seemed to be the veritable unobstructed outcome of the innermost man. He had much prudence, much conscientiousness, and there were occasions when these virtues were the cause of overmuch disquietude in him. On a passage, so long as his craft was in any proximity to land, no sleep for Captain Graveling. He took to heart those serious responsibilities not so heavily borne by some shipmasters.<br>Now while Billy Budd was down in the forecastle getting his kit together, the <em>Bellipotent</em>&#x2018;s lieutenant, burly and bluff, nowise disconcerted by Captain Graveling&#x2019;s omitting to proffer the customary hospitalities on an occasion so unwelcome to him, an omission simply caused by preoccupation of thought, unceremoniously invited himself into the cabin, and also to a flask from the spirit locker, a receptacle which his experienced eye instantly discovered. In fact he was one of those sea dogs in whom all the hardship and peril of naval life in the great prolonged wars of his time never impaired the natural instinct for sensuous enjoyment. His duty he always faithfully did; but duty is sometimes a dry obligation, and he was for irrigating its aridity, whensoever possible, with a fertilizing decoction of strong waters. For the cabin&#x2019;s proprietor there was nothing left but to play the part of the enforced host with whatever grace and alacrity were practicable. As necessary adjuncts to the flask, he silently placed tumbler and water jug before the irrepressible guest. But excusing himself from partaking just then, he dismally watched the unembarrassed officer deliberately diluting his grog a little, then tossing it off in three swallows, pushing the empty tumbler away, yet not so far as to be beyond easy reach, at the same time settling himself in his seat and smacking his lips with high satisfaction, looking straight at the host.<br>These proceedings over, the master broke the silence; and there lurked a rueful reproach in the tone of his voice: &#x2018;Lieutenant, you are going to take my best man from me, the jewel of &#x2018;em.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Yes, I know,&#x2018; rejoined the other, immediately drawing back the tumbler preliminary to a replenishing. &#x2018;Yes, I know. Sorry.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Beg pardon, but you don&#x2019;t understand, Lieutenant. See here, now. Before I shipped that young fellow, my forecastle was a rat-pit of quarrels. It was black times, I tell you, aboard the <em>Rights</em>here. I was worried to that degree my pipe had no comfort for me. But Billy came; and it was like a Catholic priest striking peace in an Irish shindy. Not that he preached to them or said or did anything in particular; but a virtue went out of him, sugaring the sour ones. They took to him like hornets to treacle; all but the buffer of the gang, the big shaggy chap with the fire-red whiskers. He indeed, out of envy, perhaps, of the newcomer, and thinking such a &#x2018;sweet and pleasant fellow,&#x2018; as he mockingly designated him to the others, could hardly have the spirit of a gamecock, must needs bestir himself in trying to get up an ugly row with him. Billy forebore with him and reasoned with him in a pleasant way--he is something like myself, Lieutenant, to whom aught like a quarrel is hateful--but nothing served. So, in the second dogwatch one day, the Red Whiskers in presence of the others, under pretense of showing Billy just whence a sirloin steak was cut--for the fellow had once been a butcher--insultingly gave him a dig under the ribs. Quick as lightning Billy let fly his arm. I dare say he never meant to do quite as much as he did, but anyhow he gave the burly fool a terrible drubbing. It took about half a minute, I should think. And, lord bless you, the lubber was astonished at the celerity. And will you believe it, Lieutenant, the Red Whiskers now really loves Billy--loves him, or is the biggest hypocrite that ever I heard of. But they all love him. Some of &#x2018;em do his washing, darn his old trousers for him; the carpenter is at odd times making a pretty little chest of drawers for him. Anybody will do anything for Billy Budd; and it&#x2019;s the happy family here. But now, Lieutenant, if that young fellow goes--I know how it will be aboard the <em>Rights</em>.

Almost killed in the Vietnam War, Joe Crane survived the bombing of his ship by following a shouting voice directing him through a blinding inferno. Later, along with his fellow deckmates who had also followed the voice, Joe discovers no human source can be found to thank. For twelve years the voice intermittently continues its calling out of Joes name until the day he decides to answer back. From that point on, there unfolds a story that not only changes Joes life, but is likely to change the life of anyone who reads it.</p><p>If you like Hardins first book, <i>The Messengers</i>, you'll love this book.

But like his celebrated teacher, Elizabeth Bishop, Gioia is meticulously painstaking and self-critical about his own poems. In an active 25-year career he has published only two previous volumes of poetry. Although Gioia is often recognized as a leading force in the recent revival of rhyme and meter in American poetry, his own work does not fit neatly into any one style. </p><p><i>Interrogations at Noon</i> displays an extraordinary range of style and sensibility&#x2015;from rhymed couplets to free verse, from surrealist elegy to satirical ballad. What unites the poems is not a single approach but their resonant musicality and powerful but understated emotion. This new collection explores the uninvited epiphanies of love and marriage, probing the quiet mysteries of a seemingly settled domestic life. Meditating on the inescapable themes of lyric poetry&#x2015;time, mortality, nature, and the contradictions of the human heart&#x2015;Gioia turns them to provocative and unexpected ends.</p></p><p><p>An acclaimed poet, essayist, anthologist, BBC commentator, and critic, <b>Dana Gioia</b> is the author of three books of poems, the pioneering essay collection <i>Can Poetry Matter?</i>, and <i>Nosferatu</i>, a libretto. He was recently nominated to be Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts and lives in Santa Rosa, California, with his family.</p>Gioia gained prominence during the 1980s as a crusader on behalf of the New Formalists--poets who wrote about everyday lives and losses in determinedly accessible, traditional modes and metres. Though his own poetry has received respectful notices, he has gained wider acclaim as a critic and editor, especially for the polemical volume Can Poetry Matter? This third book of poems (his first since 1991) will disappoint some readers, please others and surprise very few. Much of the work here expresses predictable sentiments in predictably straightforward lines--"The daylight needs no praise and so we praise it always," notes the speaker of "Words"; a husband, imagining himself as "The Voyeur," "looks and aches not only for her touch/ but for the secret that her presence brings"; a poem called "My Dead Lover" tells him or her, "Your body was the first I ever knew/ Better than my own." Domestic happiness and everyday epiphanies have produced many good poems, in and out of traditional metres, but Gioia fails to make them linguistically or emotionally compelling in any way. His real gift is for light verse; "Elegy with Surrealist Proverbs as Refrain" has a seriocomic interest beyond its absurdly reduced subjects (Andre Breton, Apollinaire and others), and the songs from Gioia's libretto Nosferatu stand out for their verve. Translations from Seneca's tragedy Hercules Furens and from the Italian poet Valerio Magrelli flesh out what would otherwise be an extremely thin volume. (Apr.) Forecast: Gioia's prolific critical activity in myriad venues has kept his brand ID solid, even after the collapse of the New Formalism. Followers of little and larger poetry magazines will buy this book just to see what Gioia's up to; libraries and others will similarly get it for the name recognition.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Vision and virtue;: Essays in Christian ethical reflection</h2><p>In describing Hauerwas&#x2019; work as Christian ethics, one can allow that phrase its full scope of meaning.

As a member of the 58th Infantry Division, he received his baptism of fire during the 1940 invasion of France. The following spring his division served on the left flank of Army Group North in Operation Barbarossa. After grueling marches admidst countless Russian bodies, burnt-out vehicles, and a great number of cheering Baltic civilians, Lubbeck&#x2019;s unit entered the outskirts of Leningrad, making the deepest penetration of any German formation. <br><br>The Germans suffered brutal hardships the following winter as they fought both Russian counterattacks and the brutal cold. The 58th Division was thrown back and forth across the front of Army Group North, from Novgorod to Demyansk, at one point fighting back Russian attacks on the ice of Lake Ilmen. Returning to the outskirts of Leningrad, the 58th was placed in support of the Spanish &#x201c;Blue&#x201d; Division. Relations between the allied formations soured at one point when the Spaniards used a Russian bath house for target practice, not realizing that Germans were relaxing inside. <br><br>A soldier who preferred to be close to the action, Lubbeck served as forward observer for his company, dueling with Russian snipers, partisans and full-scale assaults alike. His worries were not confined to his own safety, however, as news arrived of disasters in Germany, including the destruction of Hamburg where his girlfriend served as an Army nurse. <br><br>In September 1943, Lubbeck earned the Iron Cross First Class and was assigned to officers&#x2019; training school in Dresden. By the time he returned to Russia, Army Group North was in full-scale retreat. Now commanding his former heavy weapons company, Lubbeck alternated sharp counterattacks with inexorable withdrawal, from Riga to Memel on the Baltic. In April 1945 Lubbeck&#x2019;s company became stalled in a traffic jam and was nearly obliterated by a Russian barrage followed by air attacks. <br><br>In the last chaotic scramble from East Prussia, Lubbeck was able to evacuate on a newly minted German destroyer. He recounts how the ship arrived in the British zone off Denmark with all guns blazing against pursuing Russians. The following morning, May 8, 1945, he learned that the war was over.<br><br>After his release from British captivity, Lubbeck married his sweetheart, Anneliese, and in 1949 immigrated to the United States where he raised a successful family. With the assistance of David B. Hurt, he has drawn on his wartime notes and letters, Soldatbuch, regimental history and personal memories to recount his four years of frontline experience. Containing rare firsthand accounts of both triumph and disaster, At Leningrad&#x2019;s Gates provides a fascinating glimpse into the reality of combat on the Eastern Front.<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>Preface<br>Introduction<br><br>PROLOGUE<br>1.

His work includes Gaijin, Pulp Heroes, Protector and he is the writer and artist of Young Ronin.Grade 10 Up&#x2013;Richard Junkin is a former pro-football player turned used-car salesman after blowing out his knee during a key play. Unfortunately, he is too honest to be a good salesman and consistently loses customers. His boss offers him a new opportunity: to be his daughter's personal bodyguard. Caring only for the New York club scene and making headlines to embarrass her father, Victoria doesn't make Junk's new job easy. It doesn't take him long to fall hard for her, and she takes full advantage of his good nature. The story takes a dark turn when Junk catches a man attempting to rape Victoria and kills him. The two get ensnared in a delicate web of violence and intrigue as they try to keep the murder a secret. Azzarello has created an authentic noir world in which the characters are not only out for themselves, but also out to get everyone else. Santos's black-and-white artwork mixes a simplified but realistic look with the heavy shadows reminiscent of Frank Miller's work, creating a gritty, dangerous feel throughout. Fans of hard-edged crime fiction along the lines of George Pelecanos and Joseph Finder will find the territory familiar but still thrilling as Junk learns that the only way he can survive in this heartless world is by becoming more cutthroat and manipulative than anyone else. Violence, drug and alcohol use, and graphic portrayal of sexual situations make this a title for mature readers.<i>&#x2013;Matthew L.

The book shows not only the interiors that are well known, but celebrates the extraordinary span of Rome, the city that is a microcosm of the whole of European history. From its ancient past, its Renaissance and Baroque splendour, and right up to its emergence as the capital of a unified Italy, Rome has been at the forefront of architecture. As a city it has more sites of a special value than any other in Europe, and the authors have taken great care to bring a cross-section of this richness. Colour photography by Francesco Venturi captures the beauty and diversity of some of the world&#39;s most outstanding interiors, ranging from Antiquity to Art Deco. But, as with all other books in this series, &#34;Inside Rome&#34; is fun; a reference book for the visitor, but also a companion for all those who know and love this greatest of cities.</p><p></p><h2>Jesus: The Compassion of God (Theology and Life Series)</h2><p>A book about Jesus and God.

Ever since the late 1960s when Yves Saint Laurent and Paco Rabanne presented African-inspired collections, the textiles, details, and colors of Africa have moved into the realm of high fashion. In the past few years, young designers from the continent itself have emerged as people to watch in the fashion world. Helen Jennings, editor of award-winning ARISE magazine, offers in this book a brief history of African fashion, beauty and style, follows its influence on modern designers, and spotlights the best designers, photographers, and models from across the continent and the African diaspora. Profiling popular lines such as Duro Olowu, Jewel by Lisa, Black Coffee, and Eric Raisina, Jennings explores the myriad reasons why African fashion is having its moment in the sun. She shows show designers are looking beyond clich�s of the African aesthetic by embracing both traditional and contemporary fabrics and garments, and how the passion for ethically and environmentally conscious clothing is fueling this trend. As colorful and exciting as the fashions it features, this volume will appeal to anyone interested in following the world&#x2019;s most exciting new fashion development.</p><p>From Africa-inspired to African-made, this guide is the first to celebrate a new wave of fashion designers who are emerging on the global stage.HELEN JENNINGS is one of Europe&#39;s pre-eminent fashion journalists as well as the editor of ARISE, a magazine that celebrates African fashion, music and culture.

BUT SHE IS ABOUT TO DISCOVER A SHATTERING SECRET FROM THE PAST THAT WILL CHANGE HER FUTURE FOREVER....</b> <br> Growing up in the ghettos of Washington, D.C., the cards are stacked against a hardworking dreamer like Rain Arnold. Rain has fought to be the best daughter she can: she studies hard and gets good grades; she helps her mother cook and clean. And unlike her defiant younger sister, she avoids the dangers of the city streets as if her life depends on it...and it does. But Rain can't suppress the feeling that she has never truly fit in, that she is a stranger in her own world. <br> Then one fateful night, Rain overhears something she shouldn't: a heartbreaking revelation from the past, a long-buried secret that is about to change her life in ways she never could have imagined. In the blink of an eye, everything Rain has ever known -- the family she has loved and the familiar place she has called home is left behind, and Rain is sent to live with total strangers, the wealthy Hudson family. But just as she did not belong to the troubled world she was raised in, Rain is also out of place in this realm of luxury and privilege. With nowhere to turn, Rain finds an escape in the theater, inside the walls of an exclusive private school. But will it be enough to fulfill her heart's deepest wish -- and give her a place to call home?</p><p>One of the most popular authors of all time, V.C.

Andrews at Facebook.com/OfficialVCAndrews.<b>Chapter One: The Beginning of the End</b><br><br>For as long as I could remember, we lived in an apartment located in a building complex everyone called The Projects. Even as a little girl I hated the name. It didn't sound like a home, a place to live with your family. It sounded just like the word suggested: some government undertaking, some attempt to deal with the poor, some bureaucrat's program. Beni called it The Cages, which made me feel like we were being treated like animals.<br><br>I suppose at one time the buildings looked clean and new. In the beginning there wasn't gang graffiti scribbled madly over every available space creating the Books of Madness, as I liked to describe them. The streets in front weren't dirty and the small patches of lawn didn't look mangy and sick. Now the whole place seemed like someone's ashtray.<br><br>Our apartment was on the second floor: two-fifteen. We were lucky because we could use the stairway when the elevator was broken, which was often, and we weren't on the first floor where there was a greater chance for burglaries. Some of the tenants on the first floor actually had bars installed in their windows, which was why Beni named the complex The Cages. It didn't do any good to tell her that bars on cages were meant to keep animals in, not people out. She claimed the government wanted to keep us locked inside.<br><br>"We're like some ugly pimple on the face of the capital. I bet the government people don't want foreigners to see us. That's why they don't take them through our streets," she declared, parroting one of Ken's frequent speeches of self-pity.<br><br>I couldn't deny that there was a lot of fear and crime around us. Everyone had some kind of an alarm and often they went off accidentally. It had gotten so no one paid much attention to them. If there was ever an example of The Boy Who Cried Wolf, it was here in The Projects.<br><br>Beni, Roy and I had only three city blocks to walk to school, but sometimes we felt we were going through a minefield in a war zone. During the last six months, two people had been killed by stray bullets fired from passing cars, one gang shooting at members of another without regard for innocent bystanders. Everyone thought it was terrible, but went on and accepted it as if it was simply a part of what had to be, like some nasty storm coming through. There wasn't much anyone could do about bad weather and most people had the same attitude about our street crime.<br><br>Mama was visibly terrified whenever one of us went out after dark. She'd actually start to tremble. I began to think we weren't living much differently than people in the Middle Ages. When our teacher talked about the fortresses, the moats and drawbridges and the dangers that lurked outside the fortress walls back then, I thought about The Projects now. Beside having alarms and bars on windows, everyone locked his doors three or four ways with chain locks, bolts and bars and did the same with the windows. Many of the elderly sat away from their windows and shivered at the sounds of the night, the screaming in the hallways.<br><br>From my window I could just manage to see the lights in some of the government buildings, and when we walked a few blocks east and looked toward the Capitol, we could see the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial all lit up with promises. We were able to take some class trips to the sites and even tour places like the Treasury Building where we saw money being printed, and the FBI building, where we learned about crime labs and fingerprints. We never saw the Congress in action, but we did visit the buildings.<br><br>f0 <br><br>I sometimes felt like an astronaut on these class trips. It was as if we were being transported to another planet. We saw the fine homes, the embassies, how rich and prosperous people were. We heard about all the wonderful hopes these buildings and monuments represented, but we always returned to our reality where it was possible to witness a drug sale on the corner, or see an unattended child wandering near broken glass and rusty metal. What will become of him? I wondered. What will become of us? In school we studied about democracy and we were taught dreams that were apparently reserved for other sleeping faces, not ours.<br><br>Recently, someone overdosed on heroin under a stairwell in our building. The police swarmed over the hallway like blue bees and then left as quickly as they had come, none of them seemed surprised or even concerned. I think they, too, had come to accept the horrors the same way we had.<br><br>Mama always dreamed of getting us out of here, of course. To me it seemed most of the people who lived here could no longer even imagine that for themselves. Mama wouldn't talk to anyone but us about it because she hated the dark, heavy notes of discouragement. Once, when Ken was doing well, not drinking as much and making a decent wage, we were able to put away enough money to actually consider the possibility of at least renting a small house in a better neighborhood, but then one day Ken went and secretly withdrew the money. I remember how Mama came home looking drained of blood after she had discovered what he had done.<br><br>"He killed our dreams," she mumbled.<br><br>I thought Mama was going to have a heart attack. Her lips looked so blue and she seemed to have trouble breathing. She had to have a shot glass full of whiskey to calm herself. She sat staring out the window most of the afternoon, sat there gazing down at the streets with a strange, soft smile on her face and hummed an old tune as if she were looking at a beautiful field or majestic mountains. I tried to talk to her, give her something to eat, but she didn't seem to hear me. I was very frightened, afraid for all of us.<br><br>Finally, Ken came home. Roy wasn't there at the time. I was glad of that because there would have been a fight for sure. Beni and I were in our bedroom doorway, holding our breath. We expected Mama was going to explode with a fury we had never seen before, but she fooled us. She spoke calmly in the beginning, just asking him to tell her why he had done such a thing without telling her, and what he had done with the money. At first, we thought he wasn't going to tell. He moved across the kitchen, getting himself a beer, wrapping his long, thick fingers around the bottle, opening it and taking a long gulp. He leaned against the counter by the sink.<br><br>"I needed it," he finally said, "to pay a debt."<br><br>"A debt? What debt? The electric bill that's past due? The dentist bills for Beni and Rain? What debt, Ken?" she demanded.<br><br>"A debt," he repeated. He avoided her eyes. She rose slowly.<br><br>"Some of that money was money I slaved to earn. Don't I have a right to know where it's gone?" she asked, still remarkably softly for her.<br><br>"I had a debt," he repeated.<br><br>She seemed to inflate, her small shoulders rising, her bosom lifting. I looked at Beni. Her face was full of anger and my stomach felt like hornets had built a nest inside.<br><br>"You gambled away our money, didn't you, Ken Arnold? Go on, tell me. You just threw away all that money, months and months of work, gone!"<br><br>He turned to face her, the beer bottle to his lips, his neck working like the body of a snake. Suddenly, Mama slapped the bottle out of his hand and it flew across the kitchen and smashed on the floor.<br><br>Ken was stunned. For a moment he couldn't move. He was so amazed at her aggression and her anger, it stopped him from breathing too. For Beni and me the sight of Mama, all five feet four, one hundred and five pounds of her fuming in front of Ken with his six feet five inch, two hundred and fifty-pound body with his massive shoulders and thick neck, was terrifying. He could squash her like a fly, but she stuck her face into his and didn't blink.<br><br>"You go and destroy my hope just like that and then tell me it was some debt? You go and spill my blood and sweat in the street and tell me it's just some debt?"<br><br>"Back off, woman," Ken said, but I saw he was shaking. Whether he was shaking with his own overwhelming anger or fear was not clear. Suddenly though, he realized we were there, too, and his pride reared up like a sleeping lion.<br><br>"What do you think you're doing slapping my beer across the room? Huh?" he roared, his eyes wide. "You're a crazy woman and I ain't standing here and listening to a crazy woman."<br><br>He turned and rushed out of the house. Mama stood looking after him for a moment and then she went to clean up the mess. I jumped to help her.<br><br>"Watch you don't cut yourself, Rain," she warned in a low, tired voice as I picked up the pieces of glass. Beni was still shivering in her chair.<br><br>"I'll do it, Mama," I said.<br><br>She didn't argue. She went to her bedroom to lie down. I thought she might never get up, but somehow, Mama found the resilience to fight on, to restore her optimism, to replant in her garden of hope and dream on for all of us.<br><br>I think it was Mama's courage more than anything that kept me full of dreams, too. If she could be this way after what had happened to her, I thought, I, who was so much younger and still had so much of a chance, had to be full of heart. I had to hold onto my smiles and not be like Beni. I had to push back the urge to hate everyone and everything. I had to see blue sky and stars even in days of rain, so many days of rain.<br><br>Our school was nothing to look at. In fact, I often closed my eyes when I first turned the corner and the tired, broken-down building appeared. It looked more like a factory than a school and all the windows on it had bars. There was a chain link fence around the property, too, with big metal signs warning against trespassing.<br><br>Two uniformed guards were at the front entrance when the students first arrived for class. To get into the building, we all had to pass through one of those metal detectors you see at the airports. On too many occasions, students, especially gang members, had slashed other students with knives and on one occasion, a tenth-grade boy was found carrying a loaded revolver. The teachers were adamant about added security. There was almost a strike before the powers that be installed the metal detector and kept uniformed guards patrolling the halls and supporting the teachers.<br><br>Mr. McCalester, my history teacher, said all the teachers should be given battle pay as well as their salaries. He made it sound like we should all be thankful if we made it through a school day without being harmed. It was hard to concentrate and care about poetry and plays, algebra and geometry, chemistry and biology while outside the fenced-in area angry young men waited to destroy each other and anyone who got in their way.<br><br>Most of my and Beni's friends were battle worn, veterans of the hard streets. Everyone knew about drugs and no one was surprised to find someone using crack, pot or whatever happened to be the flavor of the day. Neither Beni nor I ever used or tried any of it. Roy was the same way. There were times when I was afraid Beni would give in. Girlfriends challenged us, said we weren't being "sistas" and we were acting stuck-up.<br><br>Some of the girls resented me anyway because of my looks. Mama always taught me that vanity was a sin, but I couldn't help wondering if I had been given some special gifts. My hair was straighter, richer than most. I had a creamy caramel complexion, never bothered much by acne. I also had light brown eyes, more toward almond, with long eyelashes. Roy once said he thought I could be a model, but I was afraid to even wish for such a thing. I was afraid to wish for anything good. Nice things had to happen to us accidentally, by surprise. If you wish for something too hard, I thought, it was like holding a balloon too tightly. It would simply burst, splattering your dream into pieces of nothing.<br><br>When I was younger, Mama loved to brush my hair and hum one of the soft melodies her mama had sung to her.<br><br>"You're going to be a beautiful young lady, Rain," she would whisper softly in my ear, "but you've got to know that beauty can be a burden too. You've got to learn to say no and watch yourself more because men will be looking at you more."<br><br>Her warnings frightened me. I couldn't help but walk through the school corridors with my eyes firmly fixed straight ahead, not returning a glance, not welcoming a smile. I knew most of the kids thought I was a snob, but I reacted this way because of the tiny hummingbird that fluttered in my heart every time a boy gazed at me with interest. That flutter sent a chill through my spine and down to my feet. I'd almost rather be unattractive, I thought.<br><br>I know Beni didn't think she was pretty, even though I thought she had nice features and beautiful ebony eyes. She had a bigger bust than I did and liked to keep a button or two undone or wear tighter clothes, but she was wider in the hips and Roy always criticized her for looking like a tramp. My lips were thinner and my nose was straighter and more narrow than Beni's. Sometimes, when Beni wasn't looking, I would study her face more and try to find resemblances between us. She and Roy looked more alike, although his hair was closer to mine.<br><br>Once, I asked Mama about it and she said sometimes your grandparents show up in you more than your parents do. I thought about it and studied the pictures we had of Ken's parents and Mama's parents, but I didn't see resemblances to me in any of them.<br><br>Neither Mama's nor Ken's parents were alive. Ken's father had been killed in a car accident and his mother had died of liver damage caused by alcohol. Mama's mother died before her father. She had had a heart attack. I got to meet my grandfather, but he lived in North Carolina and he died of emphysema before I was five, so I didn't remember all that much about him except he smoked so much, I thought it came out of his ears as well as his nose and his mouth. Mama had one sister in Texas. Her name was Alana, and she had a brother named Lamar somewhere in Florida. They rarely contacted each other. I never met Lamar, but I did meet Alana one Christmas when I was seven.<br><br>Ken never talked about his older brother Curtis, who was in prison in Oklahoma for armed robbery. A man was killed so he had been given a long sentence.<br><br>Aunt Alana was supposed to have had a baby she gave away, but we didn't know any real details about it except that it was a girl. Sometimes, Beni and I would wonder aloud. We imagined she would be about our age and she probably looked a little like one of us. Occasionally, Beni would tease Roy and say things like, "Be careful 'bout the girls you sleep with, Roy. One might be your cousin."<br><br>Roy hated that. He hated it when Beni talked about sex. He was always after her to put something on lately, too. She would parade about in her panties and bra and sometimes, she would put on a robe with nothing underneath and not tie it too tightly. Roy would get so angry his eyes would nearly explode. He had Ken's temper for sure, only not for the same reasons.<br><br>He was different with me. If he caught sight of me underdressed, he looked away or walked away quickly. I always tried to be properly dressed if I was in the kitchen or the living room.<br><br>Despite his gruff manner at times, Roy was as loving and as protective a brother as Beni or I could want. He tried to be right beside us as much as he could be when we were in the streets. Now that he was taking a job at Slim's Garage after school, he was troubled about our walking home without him. He had told us both at least six times to be sure we went directly home and not stop at any of the jukebox joints to listen to hip-hop music. "The worst types hang out there," he warned.<br><br>"He just wants to keep us little girls forever," Beni compla...</p><h2>Wonder Woman: Ends of the Earth</h2><p>At the ends of the universe, Wonder Woman falls victim to the Black Horizon, risking the safety of her soul.

A demonic web-maker, a soap-opera-ish complicator, he was an art-novelist almost cruelly determined to keep his authorial voice out of the picture altogether. Here, solely in the most mundane dialogue and through discomfortingly plain letters, he tells the ``story'' of two old sisters who live in Rio--Nidia and Luci--both from Argentina originally and both living what at first seem utterly vicarious lives. Luci is taken up with the romantic entanglements of a neighbor woman, a psychologist; while Nidia--once Luci leaves to visit her son in Switzerland--becomes enmeshed in the pathetic goings-on of her building's doorman, one of Rio's underclass. Luci dies in Europe, a fact that everyone tries to keep from Nidia (who's also not long before lost a grown daughter to cancer)--and for a while, Nidia's letters are sent into the void. But if Puig has an agenda, it may be that no story is void-bound; for everyone talks to everyone else, is involved in everyone else's life, as mere puzzle pieces of one greater story still. The psychologist neighbor becomes just as transmittingly involved in the old ladies' lives as they were in hers; and Puig manages to stuff an awful lot of psychology and sociology and humor into the flattest of fictional textures. Nidia and Luci are adorable dupes--but, Puig seems to say, who isn't? An extraordinary novel from a very special writer. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

As theoretical ecologist Robert E. Ulanowicz observes in his new work, <i>A Third Window</i>, neither of these models is sufficient for explaining how real change&#x2014;in the form of creative advance or emergence&#x2014;takes place in nature.The metaphysical foundations laid by these great thinkers centuries ago are ill suited to sustain today's search for a comprehensive description of complex living systems. Ecosystem dynamics, for example, violate each and every one of the Newtonian presuppositions. Hence, Ulanowicz offers his titular "third window"&#x2014;a new way of understanding evolution and other natural processes beyond the common mechanistic or materialistic philosophies of nature. Drawing on the writings of Walter Elsasser, Karl Popper, Gregory Bateson, Robert Rosen, and Alfred North Whitehead, as well as his own experience as a theoretical ecologist, Ulanowicz offers a new set of axioms for how nature behaves. Chance and disarray in natural processes are shown to be necessary conditions for real change. Randomness is shown to contribute richness and autonomy to the natural world.The metaphysical implications of these new axioms will lend <i>A Third Window</i> a wide appeal not only among scientists, but also among philosophers, theologians, and general readers who follow the science and religion dialogue. Ulanowicz's fresh perspective adds a new voice to the discussion.<p></p></p><p><p>Robert E. Ulanowicz was appointed professor emeritus after thirty-eight years with the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science at the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory in Solomons, Maryland. He is author of <i>Growth and Development: Ecosystems Phenomenology</i> and <i>Ecology, the Ascendant Perspective</i>. Ulanowicz was awarded the 2007 Ilya Prigogine Medal from the Wessex Institute and the University of Siena for outstanding research in the field of ecological systems.</p></p><h2>How to Entice an Earl (Ugly Ducklings Trilogy)</h2><p><p><b>How to Entice an Earl</b><br><b></b></p><p><b>Manda Collins</b></p><p>Lady Madeline Essex is the last of the unwed "ducklings" in her family&#x2015;and by far the most outspoken.

She had listened to him recount the legends about heavierthan- air flying machines built by the Ancients, and dismiss them, sadly, as mere fairy tales, because all his experiments had led him to believe that heavier-than-air flight was impossible. But it seemed to her that someone in Mayda did not agree. Someone in this city was designing a flying machine, or at least a glider.

The two men were still a half block behind. They&#x2019;d kept the same distance since he&#x2019;d noticed them soon after coming out of the hotel. He wasn&#x2019;t sure why they bothered him. Both were tall and clean-cut, about his age. They were respectably dressed in dark slacks and overcoats. At a glance, they appeared unthreatening. They could be bankers headed home after a late night at the office. College buddies hurrying to the Princeton Club for a last round before closing. More likely, they were two of the approximately three hundred guests who had suffered through the dinner given in his honor.<br><br> And yet . . . they disturbed him.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, sweetheart,&#x201d; said Bolden. &#x201c;What were you saying?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Where are you going to put it?&#x201d; Jennifer Dance asked. &#x201c;You know . . . in your apartment?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Put it?&#x201d; Bolden glanced at the large sterling-silver plate cradled in Jenny&#x2019;s arms. &#x201c;You mean I&#x2019;m supposed to keep it on display?&#x201d;<br><br> The plate looked like the one awarded to the women&#x2019;s singles champion at Wimbledon. This one, however, was engraved with the words &#x201c;Thomas F. Bolden. Harlem Boys Club Man of the Year.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d won plaques, medals, scrolls, and trophies, but never a plate. He wondered what joker at the club had thought it up. Curling an arm over Jenny&#x2019;s shoulders, he drew her close and said, &#x201c;No, no, no. This beautifully crafted hunk of lead is going straight into the closet.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You should be proud of it,&#x201d; Jenny protested.<br><br> &#x201c;I am proud of it, but it&#x2019;s still going in the closet.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t have to be the first thing you see when you walk in. We&#x2019;ll put it someplace discreet. Maybe on the side table in the hall leading from your bedroom to the bathroom. You worked hard for this. You deserve to feel good about yourself.&#x201d;<br><br> Bolden looked at Jenny and grinned. &#x201c;I feel fine about myself,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t want to be reminded how great I am every time I go take a leak. It&#x2019;s so . . . I don&#x2019;t know . . . so New York.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c; &#x2018;It ain&#x2019;t bragging if you can do it,&#x2019; &#x201d; Jenny said. &#x201c;Those are your words.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I was talking about dunking a basketball. Now, that&#x2019;s an accomplishment for a thirty-two-year-old white male who fudges about being six feet tall. Next time get a picture of that, and I&#x2019;ll put it on the table leading to the bathroom. Framed even.&#x201d;<br><br> Nearing midnight on a Tuesday in mid-January, the narrow streets of the city&#x2019;s financial district were deserted. The night sky hung low, gray clouds scudding between the skyscrapers like fast-moving ships. The temperature hovered at forty degrees, unseasonably warm for this time of year. There was talk of a major storm system hitting the Eastern seaboard, but the meteorologists looked to have it wrong this time.<br><br> The annual gala benefiting the Harlem Boys Club had ended thirty minutes earlier. It had been a ritzy affair: white tablecloths, champagne cocktails, a four-course meal with fresh seafood instead of chicken. Bolden had been too nervous about giving his speech to enjoy the event. Besides, it wasn&#x2019;t his style. Too much backslapping. Too many hands to shake. All that forced laughter. His cheeks felt like a punching bag from all the busses he&#x2019;d gotten.<br><br> All in all, the event raised an even three hundred thousand dollars. His cheeks could take a little roughing up for that kind of change.<br><br> A drop of rain hit his nose. Bolden looked up, waiting for the next, but nothing followed. He pulled Jenny closer and nuzzled her neck. From the corner of his eye, he saw that the two men were still there, maybe a little farther back, walking side by side, talking animatedly. It wasn&#x2019;t the first time lately that he&#x2019;d had the sensation of being followed. There&#x2019;d been a night last week when he&#x2019;d felt certain someone had been trailing him near his apartment on Sutton Place. And just today at lunch, he&#x2019;d been aware of a presence hovering nearby. A nagging feeling that someone was eyeing him. On neither occasion, however, had he been able to put a face to his fears.<br><br> And now there were these two.<br><br> He glanced at Jenny and caught her staring at him. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s my Tommy,&#x201d; she said with her all-knowing smile. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re so afraid of letting it go.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Letting what go?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The past. The whole &#x2018;Tommy B. from the wrong side of the tracks&#x2019; thing. You still walk as if you&#x2019;re on the mean streets of the Windy City. Like a mobster on the lam or something, afraid someone&#x2019;s going to recognize you.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I do not,&#x201d; he said, then forced himself to push his shoulders back and stand a little straighter. &#x201c;Anyway, that&#x2019;s who I am. It&#x2019;s where I come from.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;And this is where you are now. This is your world, too. Look at yourself. You&#x2019;re a director at the snobbiest investment bank on Wall Street. You have dinner all the time with politicians and big shots. All those people didn&#x2019;t show up tonight for me . . . they came for you. What you&#x2019;ve achieved is pretty damned impressive, mister.&#x201d;<br><br> Bolden dug his hands deep into his pockets. &#x201c;Not bad for a gutter rat.&#x201d;<br><br> She tugged at his sleeve. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m serious, Thomas.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I guess you must be if you&#x2019;re calling me Thomas.&#x201d;<br><br> They walked a few steps, and she said, &#x201c;Come on, Tommy. I&#x2019;m not saying it&#x2019;s time to join the Four Hundred. I&#x2019;m just saying it&#x2019;s time to let the past go. This is your world now.&#x201d;<br><br> Bolden shook his head. &#x201c;Naw, I&#x2019;m just passing through.&#x201d;<br><br> Jenny raised her eyes, exasperated. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been passing through for seven years. That&#x2019;s long enough for someone from Swaziland to become an American citizen. Don&#x2019;t you think it&#x2019;s enough to make you a New Yorker? Besides, it&#x2019;s not such a bad place. Why don&#x2019;t you stay awhile?&#x201d;<br><br> Bolden stopped. Taking both of Jenny&#x2019;s hands in his, he turned to face her. &#x201c;I love it here, too. But you know me . . . I like to keep my distance. I just don&#x2019;t want to get too close to them. All the guys at work. The stuffed shirts. You gotta keep your distance, or else they suck you in. Like body snatchers.&#x201d;<br><br> Jenny put her head back and laughed. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re your friends.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Associates, yes. Colleagues, maybe. But friends? I don&#x2019;t recall getting too many invitations to dine at my friends&#x2019; homes. Though that may very well change after the looks I caught a couple of those sleazebags giving you tonight.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You jealous?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Damn straight.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Really?&#x201d; Jenny smiled disarmingly.<br><br> She was tall and blond, with an athlete&#x2019;s toned body, and the best skyhook since Kareem. Her face was open and honest, given to determined stares and crooked smiles. She taught seventh, eighth, and ninth grade at a special ed school in the Village. She liked to say that it was just like the school in Little House on the Prairie, all the kids in one classroom, except that her kids were what the system labeled high-risk teens. High-risk teens were the bad eggs: the boys and girls who&#x2019;d been expelled from their ordinary schools and were doing time with Jenny until they could be reformed, remolded, and reassigned to a public school that would take them. They were quite a bunch. Drug dealers, thieves, hustlers, and hookers, and not one over the age of fifteen. She wasn&#x2019;t a teacher, so much as a lion tamer.<br><br> &#x201c;By the way,&#x201d; she said nonchalantly. &#x201c;Dinner&#x2019;s been over awhile and you still have your tie on.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Do I?&#x201d; Bolden&#x2019;s hand shot to his neck. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s begun. The body snatchers have me. Pretty soon, I&#x2019;ll be wearing pink shirts and white loafers and putting on tight black bicycle shorts when I hit the gym. I&#x2019;ll start listening to opera and o-pining about wine. I may even join a country club.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;They&#x2019;re not so bad. Our kids would love it.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Kids!&#x201d; Bolden stared at her, aghast. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re one of them, too! I&#x2019;m done for.&#x201d;<br><br> They walked in silence for a while. Jenny tilted her head on his shoulder and laced her fingers through his. Bolden caught their reflection in a window. He was hardly a match for her. His neck was too thick, his jaw too wide, and his dark hair receding quickly at the temples. What remained was thick and peppered with gray and cut close to the scalp. Thirty-two was definitely not young in his business. His face was stern, with steadfast brown eyes, and a directness of gaze that some men found intimidating. His lips were thin, rigid. His chin split by a hatchet. He looked like a man on equal terms with uncertainty. A reliable man. A man to have at your side in the lurch. He was surprised how natural the tux looked on him. Scarier was the fact that he almost felt natural wearing it. Immediately, he yanked off his bow tie and stuffed it in his pocket.<br><br> A New Yorker, he said to himself. Mr. Big Shot with a silver plate on the way to the pisser.<br><br> No. That wasn&#x2019;t him.<br><br> He was just Tom Bolden, a kid from the Midwest with neither birthright nor pedigree, and no illusions. His mother had left when he was six. He never knew his father.

Winslow is peculiarly gifted at drawing our minds and hearts toward the Greater Joseph and His brethren. His chapters on Christ revealing Himself to His people, Christ as our brother, and the glory of Christ in heaven are alone worth the price of the book. As is true of all of Winslow&#39;s writings, this volume is a gem. Representing devotional writing at its finest, it is replete with Christ-centered memorable statements for spiritual edification. Use this book to treasure those sacred truths of Scripture that will mold your thoughts, words, and actions for Christian living.</p><p>&#34;Our Jesus, the Elder Brother, centers in Himself infinitely more than all the tender love and sympathy found in His whole Church. It was necessary that by every possible human sensibility He should be qualified to be the gracious, sympathizing Head of a suffering body; and no truth is brought out in the history of Joseph more luminously, or exquisitely touching and beautiful, as portraying the Lord Jesus Christ than the deep sensibility of Joseph&#39;s nature.&#34;--Octavius Winslow</p><h2>North Pole Legacy: Black, White and Eskimo</h2><p>Tells the story of the Amer-Eskimo sons of Matthew Henson and Robert E.

Allen Counter</b> is a neuroscientist at Harvard and the founder of the Harvard Foundation, an organization devoted to intercultural and race relations. He lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.In 1986 the author, a neuroscience professor at Harvard, went to northern Greenland to conduct a study of ear disease in Eskimos as well as to interview them about early American explorations in that area. And he had yet another goal: black himself, Counter had long admired black explorer Matthew Henson, who accompanied Robert Peary to the Pole. Familiar with rumors that each had fathered children in Greenland, the author traced "dark-skinned" Eskimos to two remote settlements, where he found Anaukaq Henson and Kali Peary, octogenarians who had never met their American relatives. Counter, who subsequently arranged a three-month trip to the U.S. for both men, here offers a charming account of their meetings with kinfolk in Massachusetts, New York and Maine, visits to their fathers' gravesites--Henson's in Brooklyn, N.Y., Peary's in Arlington, Va.--and tours of national monuments. The book, an intriguing postscript to polar exploration, also examines the Peary-Henson collaboration and supports the claim that they indeed reached the Pole.

The author&#39;s earliest years were spent in relative comfort on his grandfather&#39;s farm in East Prussia during World War II.

Someone in the Suicide Squad has turned traitor, leaving America's deadliest super-team open to attack from a vast international conspiracy bent on destroying everything that Task Force X director Amanda Waller has built.</b><br><br>Considering that "The Wall" relies less on loyalty and trust and more on brain-implanted bombs to control her crew of conscripts, finding the culprit is going to be a tall order. Any one of the rogues in this gallery--including Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Captain Boomerang, Enchantress and Killer Croc--would almost certainly climb over a pile of their teammates' corpses for the chance to escape. <br><br>But even when she's down for the count, Waller has a few aces up her sleeve, including 1) the deranged Kryptonian war criminal, General Zod, and 2) her own unequaled, bloody-minded ruthlessness.<br><br>Bending Zod to her will, however, means striking a bargain with one of Superman's deadliest enemies--and one of the only people on the planet smarter and more tenacious than Waller herself.

Jack became an earl at the age of eleven after his father died in WWI in Mesopotamia. <br><br>At age thirty-four, Jack&#x2019;s courageous spirit led him to execute a daring mission for the British government in 1940 in Paris. Under the noses of the advancing Germans he snatched top French scientists, millions of pounds worth of diamonds, armaments, heavy water (the only kind in the world), and secret documents. His trip back to England from Bordeaux was fraught with danger in mine and submarine infested waters. His mission remained Top Secret throughout the war years and beyond, even to his closest family. His adventure in Paris earned him the nickname of &#x2018;Mad Jack&#x2019;. <br><br>His next chosen mission was again of prime importance and extremely dangerous, a secret more closely guarded than radar. He began working in bomb disposal in close proximity with his secretary Beryl, and Fred his chauffeur, and the three became widely known as The Holy Trinity. Whenever an unexploded bomb was reported, it was quickly brought to the Earl&#x2019;s attention, especially if it was tricky. Thirty four bombs were successfully defused by The Holy Trinity and their loyal team of Royal Engineers. The thirty-fifth bomb blew them up.<br><br>The Holy Trinity were the only World War II civilian casualties working in Bomb Disposal.

She lives in Port Huron, Michigan.<br><br><b>Michael Garland </b>has won numerous awards for his work. He is the illustrator of the Golden Kite Honor Award-winning <i>Leah's Pony</i>, by Elizabeth Friedrich. He lives with his family in Patterson, New York.In the third century, long before "Jolly Old St. Nicholas" became associated with the Christmas season, the man who would one day inspire that legend lived in the Mediterranean coastal town of Patara (in what is now Turkey). For this informative picture-book biography, Tompert (Saint Patrick) weaves together some of the most striking legends related to St. Nicholas. Becoming a bishop at such a tender age that he was called the Boy Bishop, Nicholas performed miracles in caring for his people, and his deeds were later to make him the patron saint of such diverse groups as women seeking husbands, students, sailors and more. Though this volume lacks a central compelling drama, Tompert employs a swift-moving chronology to emphasize Nicholas's purity, selflessness and faith. Departing from the style of his previous works, Garland's (Angel Cat; Leah's Pony) jewel-toned, mixed-media paintings mimic stone mosaic work; each element is composed of a mesh of tiny blocks. One quibble: the characters' expressions range chiefly from somber to distressed, and the heavy mood may prove off-putting to young readers. An author's note describes how Nicholas was viewed throughout history, including his modern evolution into Santa Claus. Ages 6-up.

Baldasty argues that broad changes in American society, the national economy, and the newspaper industry brought about this dramatic shift.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Increasingly in the nineteenth century, news became a commodity valued more for its profitablility than for its role in informing or persuading the public on political issues.&nbsp; Newspapers started out as highly partisan adjuncts of political parties.&nbsp; As advertisers replaced political parties as the chief financial support of the press, they influenced newspapers in directing their content toward consumers, especially women.&nbsp; The results were recipes, fiction, contests, and features on everything from sports to fashion alongside more standard news about politics.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Baldasty makes use of nineteenth-century materials&#x2014;newspapers from throughout the era, manuscript letters from journalists and politicians, journalism and advertising trade publications, government reports&#x2014;to document the changing role of the press during the period.&nbsp; He identifies three important phases: the partisan newspapers of the Jacksonian era (1825-1835), the transition of the press in the middle of the century, and the influence of commercialization of the news in the last two decades of the century.</p></p><p>Gerald J.

But not for our 13-year-old hero, who's forced to spend his summers with an aunt, uncle, and cousin who detest him. The third book in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series catapults into action when the young wizard "accidentally" causes the Dursleys' dreadful visitor Aunt Marge to inflate like a monstrous balloon and drift up to the ceiling. Fearing punishment from Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon (and from officials at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who strictly forbid students to cast spells in the nonmagic world of Muggles), Harry lunges out into the darkness with his heavy trunk and his owl Hedwig. <p> As it turns out, Harry isn't punished at all for his errant wizardry. Instead he is mysteriously rescued from his Muggle neighborhood and whisked off in a triple-decker, violently purple bus to spend the remaining weeks of summer in a friendly inn called the Leaky Cauldron. What Harry has to face as he begins his third year at Hogwarts explains why the officials let him off easily. It seems that Sirius Black--an escaped convict from the prison of Azkaban--is on the loose. Not only that, but he's after Harry Potter. But why? And why do the Dementors, the guards hired to protect him, chill Harry's very heart when others are unaffected? Once again, Rowling has created a mystery that will have children and adults cheering, not to mention standing in line for her next book. Fortunately, there are four more in the works.

"Of all the books published so far in this century," Clifton Fadiman once said, "the one most assured of being read a hundred years from now is <em>A Study of History</em>." <em>The Los Angeles Times</em> called it "a veritable masterpiece of erudition and one of the most suggestive, stimulating and inspiring studies of this age."<br> In <em>The Study</em>, Toynbee revolutionized the writing of history. By encompassing virtually all civilizations--the Egyptian, the Sumeric, the Mayan, the Iranian, the Japanese, the Hellenic, and the West, to name only a few--within the scope of his monumental work, he achieved the first all-embracing synthesis of world history. Before Toynbee, world histories were histories of the West, and only specialists wrote Babylonian, Arabian, or Aztec history. But Toynbee's scheme includes all nations and, more remarkably, by his emphasis on general patterns--on the genesis, growth and breakdown of civilizations--he was able to give a shape to this incredibly diverse material, making it comprehendable to the general reader.<br> And Somervell's Abridgement is also a masterpiece--a masterpiece of condensation. In only two volumes, he has captured the method, atmosphere, texture, and, in most instances, the very words of the original. By leaving out most of Toynbee's illustrations, digressions, and asides (some of which were quite lengthy indeed), Somervell has actually clarified the argument of the book. The reaction to his Abridgement, when the first volume appeared in 1947, was exceptional: it was an immediate success in America, and exerpts and articles on it appeared in <em>The Atlantic Monthly</em>, <em>Life</em>, <em>The New York</em> <em>Times Book sums it Review</em>, <em>Newsweek</em>, and <em>Time</em>.

Using Ireland, England, France, and the United States as examples, Larry Zuckerman shows how daily life from the 1770s until World War I would have been unrecognizable-perhaps impossible-without the potato, which functioned as fast food, famine insurance, fuel and labor saver, budget stretcher, and bank loan, as well as delicacy. Drawing on personal diaries, contemporaneous newspaper accounts, and other primary sources, this is popular social history at its liveliest and most illuminating.</p></p><p>During the 17th and 18th centuries, the potato was berated, feared, and loathed. It was blamed for everything from population explosions to population implosions, not to mention social upheaval and financial despair. Yet now, with the luxury of hindsight, Larry Zuckerman regards the potato as a saving grace for Western civilization, a crop that protected populations from starvation, encouraged self-sufficiency, and improved the lives of ordinary people. The potato's roller-coaster journey from dreary boiled peasant food into the most widely consumed vegetable on the planet is chronicled in this refreshing history lesson. <i>The Potato</i> goes way beyond the usual scope of spud history, which commonly focuses on the Irish Potato Famine of the 1840s. Although this disaster is a key event in the book, the potato's broader influence in the Western world was far more complex--changing the shape of agrarian societies, triggering world emigration, and even influencing social-welfare reforms. Snippets from journals, newspaper editorials, and government documents make this a convincing and fascinating glimpse of four centuries' worth of a vegetable to which we normally wouldn't give a second thought. <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i><p><b>Larry Zuckerman</b> is a freelance editor and writer.

An unusual piece of cheese. Made from an old family recipe, Ambrosio&#x2019;s cheese was reputed to be among the finest in the world, and was said to hold mystical qualities. Eating it, some claimed, conjured long-lost memories. But then, Ambrosio said, things had gone horribly wrong. . . .<br> &nbsp;<br> By the time the two men exited the telling room that evening, Paterniti was hooked. Soon he was fully embroiled in village life, relocating his young family to Guzm�n in order to chase the truth about this cheese and explore the fairy tale&#x2013;like place where the villagers conversed with farm animals, lived by an ancient Castilian code of honor, and made their wine and food by hand, from the grapes growing on a nearby hill and the flocks of sheep floating over the Meseta.<br> &nbsp;<br> What Paterniti ultimately discovers there in the highlands of Castile is nothing like the idyllic slow-food fable he first imagined. Instead, he&#x2019;s sucked into the heart of an unfolding mystery, a blood feud that includes accusations of betrayal and theft, death threats, and a murder plot. As the village begins to spill its long-held secrets, Paterniti finds himself implicated in the very story he is writing.<br> &nbsp;<br> Equal parts mystery and memoir, travelogue and history, <i>The Telling Room </i>is an astonishing work of literary nonfiction by one of our most accomplished storytellers. A moving exploration of happiness, friendship, and betrayal, <i>The Telling Room</i> introduces us to Ambrosio Molinos de las Heras, an unforgettable real-life literary hero, while also holding a mirror up to the world, fully alive to the power of stories that define and sustain us.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>The Telling Room</i></b> <br> &nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Captivating . . . Paterniti&#x2019;s writing sings, whether he&#x2019;s talking about how food activates memory, or the joys of watching his children grow.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;NPR</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A gorgeous and impassioned monument to the art and mystery of storytelling, <i>The Telling Room</i> is rich, funny, humane, devastating, and beautiful. It made me want to applaud, it made me want to cry, it made me want to move to Spain. Michael Paterniti is a genius.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Elizabeth Gilbert, author of <i>Eat, Pray, Love</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Unforgettable . . . a must-read for all who think of Spain as magical, who consider cheese as the ultimate gift of love, who love stories of betrayal, despair, revenge and redemption.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2014;The Wall Street Journal</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>The Telling Room</i> embodies the spirit of slow food and life.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Michael Pollan</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Elegant, strange, funny, and insightful, <i>The Telling Room</i> is a marvelous tale and a joyful read, a trip into a world peopled by some of the most remarkable characters&#x2014;and, yes, cheese&#x2014;in memory.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Susan Orlean, author of <i>The Orchid Thief</i></b><i><br></i></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, August 2013:</strong> The premise sounds far-fetched, even a little silly: While proofreading a deli catalog in Michigan, Michael Paterniti is bewitched by a description of cave-aged Spanish cheese; years later, disillusioned with modern life and his own &#x201c;computer-soft hands,&#x201d; he travels to its Spanish back-country source, where he becomes obsessed with its larger-than-life maker and his story of soul-stealing cheese-related betrayal. But don&#x2019;t get too cynical (or annoyed by the sprawling footnotes) too fast, or you&#x2019;ll miss the earth-stained magic of this story. Yes, Paterniti can be a hyperbolic virtuoso, &#x201c;given to tilting the most quotidian events into a Viking epic&#x201d;--or a Castillian tragedy. He even opens with this quote from Pascal: &#x201c;Imagination magnifies small objects with fantastic exaggeration until they fill our soul.&#x201d; But these &#x201c;small objects,&#x201d; en masse, do become soul-filling until Paterniti&#x2019;s life-altering epiphany in a moonlit field of sunflowers seems like an essential human experience. This transportive culinary memoir will launch a thousand gastronomical pilgrimages. <em>--Mari Malcolm</em><b>Michael Paterniti</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Driving Mr. Albert: A Trip Across America with Einstein&#x2019;s Brain</i>.

After serving in the First World War, he embarked upon a distinguished academic career and was recognized as one of the finest philologists in the world. He was a professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford, a fellow of Pembroke College, and a fellow of Merton College until his retirement in 1959. He is, however, beloved throughout the world as the creator of Middle-earth and author of such classic works as <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. He died on September 2, 1973, at the age of 81.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>With the appearance of <i>The Silmarillion</i>, the publication of<br>J. R. R. Tolkien's mythopoesis is virtually complete. The<br>reader can now appreciate the full scope and significance of the<br>history of Aman and Middle-earth, the central stages in the great<br>drama of the Creation of Eae. One can trace in detail the Light of<br>Aman from the Two Trees on Ezellohar to the renewing power of<br>the Phial of Galadriel in the stinking darkness of Shelob's Lair.<br>The terror felt there by Sam Gamgee is better understood after<br>reading of the Unlight of Ungoliant, and Boromir's desire for the<br>Ring can be seen as a wisp of the Shadow of Melkor, who lusted<br>after Light but created only Darkness. Not only do the great conflicts<br>between East and West--from the First War and the Battle of<br>the Powers to the Battle of Fornost and the War of the Ring--<br>reveal the nature of good and evil and the immeasurable compassion<br>of Iluvatar, but also, the identity of the forces that intervene<br>to give victory to the good suggests the progressive freeing of Man<br>from the influence of both Valar and demons to work out his own<br>destiny, known to Iluvatar alone.<br><br>Writing this revised edition of my <i>Guide to Middle-earth</i> has<br>enhanced my awareness of these correspondences, designs which<br>are surely central to the joy of Faerie and which give Professor<br>Tolkien's work its marvelous and profound coherence. But it has<br>also made me aware of the difference between the conception and<br>the realization of this cycle of myth and romance, between the<br>'visionary scene' and its 'frame,' 1 between the Vision and the Text.<br>The 'seamless web of Story' 2 is indeed endless and without blemish,<br>but books--and lives--alas, are not. In the first edition of the<br><i>Guide</i>, I used any information available to me that I believed came<br>from Professor Tolkien and had been transmitted accurately; I<br>hoped that these details would ultimately appear in print. But<br>now--faced with a plethora of revised texts, calendars, letters, illustrations,<br>interviews, anecdotes, and reports of conversations,<br>some containing contradictory information--I have come to believe<br>that inconsistencies, sometimes deliberately maintained by<br>Professor Tolkien, occur where the details of the Vision were not<br>clear to him, where he was stymied by a single leaf on the Tree,<br>not sure of 'its shape, and its sheen, and the glistening of dewdrops<br>on its edge,' 3 not yet ready to fix it in the Text. Yet these inconsistencies,<br>which can bulk large in an alphabetic treatment of Faerie,<br>should not be allowed to detract from the general bloom of this<br>lushly foliated Tree.<br><br>So this revised <i>Guide</i> is limited to the Text, to published works<br>by Professor Tolkien in the latest editions available to American<br>readers. The basic text for <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> is again the Ballantine<br>paperback edition, with emendations from the revised<br>Houghton Mifflin hardback edition; Appendix C contains a concordance<br>between the two editions. British editions contain several<br>further emendations, which I have not taken into account; of<br>those I have heard of or seen, the most significant is the change of<br><i>d</i> to <i>dh</i> in <i>Galadrim</i> and <i>Caras Galadon</i>, which resolves the confusion<br>(encouraged, it seems, by the Elves themselves, as Christopher<br>Tolkien's comment in <i>The Silmarillion</i> on<i> Galadhriel</i> suggests)<br>between Sindarin <i>galad</i> 'light' and<i> galadh</i> 'tree.' The three exceptions<br>to this rule of Text are sources which seem particularly trustworthy:<br>the Pauline Baynes map of Middle-earth displays a number<br>of place-names evidently given her by Professor Tolkien; Clyde<br>Kilby's intimate <i>Tolkien</i> and the<i> Silmarillion</i> contains intriguing hints<br>of the End; so much of the information contained in Professor<br>Tolkien's letters to and conversations with my friend Dick Plotz<br>has been corroborated by <i>The Silmarillion</i> that I feel confident in<br>using other items.<br><br>In general, I hope that I have not forgotten the limits of a reference<br>work. I count myself fortunate to have wandered in the<br>Fairy-realm of Arda for fifteen years now, and while my tongue is<br>certainly not tied, for the sake of my own delight I have learned<br>not 'to ask too many questions, lest the gates should be shut and<br>the keys be lost.' 4 This <i>Guide</i> is intended to be supplementary to<br>the works of Professor Tolkien and no more; its value is that it can<br>clarify deep-hidden historical facts and draw together scraps of information<br>whose relation is easily overlooked, thus aiding the<br>wanderer in Arda in his quest for its particular Truth. When matters<br>are unclear in the Text I have tried to remain silent, but those<br>places where I have been unable to restrain my conjectures are liberally<br>sprinkled with 'perhaps', 'presumably', and such words. By<br>now the entries which comprise this <i>Guide</i> represent the product<br>of ten years of intermittent labor and frequent correction by myself<br>and careful readers, until I can hope that the errors which remain<br>are more mechanical than substantive.<br><br>There is one major deviation from this conservative treatment<br>of the Text. Unlike <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, whose Appendix B provides<br>precise dates for the events of the Second and Third Ages,<br><i>The Silmarillion</i> contains little exact chronological information<br>aside from sporadic indications of the passage of years ('But when<br>Tuor had lived thus in solitude as an outlaw for four years') and<br>rough dating from the first rising of the Sun. Desiring to make the<br>information concerning the First Age more compatible with that<br>for later Ages, I have taken it upon myself to coordinate these<br>indications of time into a Chronology of the First Age (Appendix<br>A). This Chronology may help to unify in the minds of read-ers<br>the episodic sequence of events and personages in the Wars of<br>Beleriand; by counting years, it also underscores the rapid collapse<br>of Beleriand after Dagor Bragollach and the tragedies of the early<br>deaths of Huor (at 31), Turin and Nienor (36 and 27), and Dior<br>(about 39). In addition, I must confess to having succumbed to the<br>scholarly joys of writing an Appendix. The dates given for the<br>First Age, therefore, both in the entries and in Appendix A, are<br>strictly my own and should be taken as approximations rather than<br>as completely trustworthy deductions; my derivation of these<br>dates is fully explained in the Appendix.<br><br>The principles involved in determining entries are fairly<br>simple. In general, any capitalized word or phrase receives a separate<br>entry unless it is a clearly identified epithet or a translation of<br>a name not used independently of the main name; thus there is an<br>entry for <i>Sulimo</i> but not for its full translation, <i>Lord of the Breath</i> of<br><i>Arda</i>, and<i> Voronwe</i> as the epithet of Steward Mardil is not listed<br>separately. In addition, certain noncapitalized items (mostly the<br>names of species and objects, such as the great spiders and ithildin)<br>have been included. Variant spellings (which in most cases reflect<br>Professor Tolkien's further development of the Eldarin languages)<br>are noted, but most variations in the use of accent marks have<br>been ignored. Page references in main entries are to significant references<br>only; cross-references usually cite the first occurrence<br>only. Geographical entries do not always cite the maps on which<br>the place in question is shown, and historical entries occasionally<br>use dates given in Appendix B without citation; in both cases the<br>references can easily be found. References to the various Indices<br>are given only when they contain new information.<br><br>When entries are genuine forms in Middle-earth languages, I<br>have indicated this, giving translations wherever I am sure of<br>them. A question mark following a language identification or<br>translation obviously indicates uncertainty. Translated Rohirric<br>(Old English) forms are occasionally translated again into modern<br>English; the language of other forms is indicated as 'tr.--' wherever<br>I felt there was a possibility of confusing them with Elvish or<br>genuine Mannish forms. However, by and large I have not indicated<br>the language of names and terms 'Anglicized' into English,<br>Germanic, or Celtic equivalents; as Appendix F of <i>The Return of<br>the King</i> suggests, most Adunaic, Rohirric, Westron, Mannish, and<br>Hobbitish forms have been so translated. In <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> I<br>have assumed that English versions of Middle-earth names (e.g.,<br><i>Treebeard </i>for <i>Fangorn</i>) represent Westron forms used by Men and<br>Hobbits. But in <i>The Silmarillion</i> this is obviously not the case, since<br>Westron did not develop until the late Second Age. Here I have<br>assumed that the English versions, even though capitalized, are<br>merely translations intended for the convenience of the reader,<br>not translated Mannish names.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Contemporary Japanese literature: An anthology of fiction, film, and other writing since 1945</h2><p>Translations of short stories, poems, film scripts, and a full-length play offer a survey of the Japanese literary scene since the end of the Second World War</p><p>Howard Hibbett began Japanese as a sophomore at Harvard College in the Spring Term of 1942.

Keates is not a musicologist or performerhe is a Shakespeare scholar and fiction writer, but has an amateur's enthusiasm for his subject and an engaging writing style. Moreover, he is able to avail himself of recent Handel research without deadening the prose. While the writing is essentially nontechnical, there are many astute observations on Handel's musical connections with his contemporaries. Scholars will prefer the excellent bibliography and detailed chronology in Hogwood's book; its clarity and objectivity make it a requisite first choice for libraries. For larger collections, however, Keates's quirky and colorful account will be a fine addition.

Our current ideas of this country at the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula have been hijacked by images of the terrorist strongholds, drone attacks, and diplomatic tensions. But, as Mackintosh-Smith reminds us in this newly updated book, there is another Arabia. Yemen may be a part of Arabia, but it is like no place on earth.</p><p>Tim Mackintosh-Smith has lived in Yemen since 1982, earning the official title of Shaykh of Nazarenes. This, his first book, won the Thomas Cook Travel Book Award.<b>Prefatory Note</b><p>Yemeni history is at times bewilderingly complex. Although in Chapter 2 I have tried to sketch in the general lines of pre-Islamic history, I have avoided doing so for later periods so as not to overload the reader with dates and dynasties. To compensate, the Glossary includes brief notes on some of the more important rulers of Yemen; also, the Bibliography is fuller than is usual in a book of this nature. It is a book which, I admit, treads the thin line between seriousness and frivolity. If at times it veers towards the latter &#x2013; as it does, for example, when I relate the more questionable anecdotes of the medieval traveller Ibn al-Mujawir &#x2013; I can only repeat his near contemporary Yaqut&#x2019;s apologia concerning the edible monopod poets of Hadramawt: &#x2018;I have merely quoted from the books of learned men.&#x2019;</p><p>In transliterating Arabic words, I have followed the most commonly accepted system but minus the macrons and subscript dots; I have omitted initial ayns and hamzahs but have retained final ayns; the two letters are not distinguished when they occur within a word. A few readers may find this annoying, but it makes for clearer typography. Thus, the capital city of Yemen, ?an&#x2018;a&#x2019; (otherwise Sana, Sanaa and Sana&#x2019;a), appears in this book as San&#x2019;a. As for my rendering of Suqutri words, I apologize in advance to the half dozen or so scholars of that language for any deficiencies they may find.</p><p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>&#x2018;A definition is the enclosing of a wilderness of idea within a wall of words.&#x2019;</p><p>Samuel Butler, Notebooks</p><p>THE RAIN BEAT DOWN. Horns rasped against the door: a sheep trying to get in. I didn&#x2019;t blame it &#x2013; spring was late in the Isle of Harris and it was cosy inside, all peat smoke and roll-ups. An easterly gale was whistling across the Sound from Skye and flinging sackfuls of hail at the tin roof of the croft house. The noise was deafening.</p><p>You have to be somewhere quiet like Harris in the early stages of learning Arabic, somewhere you can walk around unheard, muttering strange, strangulated syllables, limbering up minute and never-used muscles of tongue and glottis. I got up to make tea. &#x2018;Hhha&#x2019;!&#x2019; I said to the matches when I found them; &#x2018;Ghghgha&#x2019;!&#x2019; when they refused to light. &#x2018; ? &#x2019; I mouthed to the hooded crow on the fence outside the window; that innocent-looking sign represented the trickiest letter of all, &#x2018;a guttural stop pronounced with constriction of the larynx&#x2019;, my grammar said. The hoodie croaked back and flapped off to peck out lambs&#x2019; eyes.</p><p>The fire let out a rich belch of smoke. I threw on another sod of peat and drew up a chair. Cowan&#x2019;s Modern Literary Arabic lay open at &#x2018;The Dual&#x2019; (not content with mere singulars and plurals, Arabic also has a form for pairs): &#x2018;The two beautiful queens&#x2019;, it said, &#x2018;are ignorant.&#x2019; The odds against ever uttering the sentence were high: grammars, like theatre, call for a suspension of disbelief. Under Cowan was an Arabic reader produced for British officers in the Palestine Mandate. At the bottom of the pile, as yet untouched, was a dictionary. I reached for it and looked at the title page. The dictionary had been compiled for the use of students and published Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam by the Catholic Press, Beirut, in 1915. As I turned its foxed pages, I broke through the wall of words into a wilderness of idea. It was another world, a surreal lexical landscape whose inhabitants lived in a state of relentless metamorphosis.</p><p>Over there was a zabab, &#x2018;a messenger&#x2019; or possibly &#x2018;a huge deaf rat&#x2019;, while in the distance grazed ana&#x2019;amah, &#x2018;an ostrich&#x2019;, although it might have been &#x2018;a signpost&#x2019;, &#x2018;a pavilion on a mountain&#x2019; or even &#x2018;a membrane of the brain&#x2019;.

He could just be suffering from sada, &#x2018;thirst&#x2019;, also &#x2018;a voice&#x2019;, &#x2018;an echo&#x2019;, &#x2018;a corpse&#x2019;, &#x2018;a brain&#x2019; or &#x2018;an owl&#x2019;. Maybe his well was makul, &#x2018;holding little water and much slime&#x2019;. He was in a bad mood so I passed on quickly, worried that he might tarqa me, &#x2018;strike me upon the clavicle&#x2019;.</p><p>In Dictionary Land you could come across a malit, &#x2018;a featherless arrow&#x2019; or &#x2018;a hairless abortive foetus&#x2019;. That, at least, showed a clear semantic link. So did firash, &#x2018;a mat/wife&#x2019;, and siffarah, &#x2018;an anus/whistle/fife&#x2019;. But other entries defied rational explanation, seeming no more than the word-associations of a hopeless head-case: you could take your qutrub, your &#x2018;puppy/demon/restless insect/melancholia&#x2019;, for a walk; qarurah could be &#x2018;the apple of one&#x2019;s eye&#x2019;, also &#x2018;a urinal&#x2019;. With a single verb, nakha&#x2019;, you could both &#x2018;slay someone&#x2019; and &#x2018;bear them sincere friendship&#x2019;; with another, istawsham, you could &#x2018;look for a tattooist&#x2019;; and if you were a calligrapher, you could be adept at yayyaya, &#x2018;forming a beautiful letter ya&#x2019; &#x2013; perhaps thus: On the culinary side, you might be akra&#x2019;, &#x2018;fond of trotters&#x2019; or &#x2018;thin in the shank&#x2019;, while with the verb karrash you could &#x2018;contract your face&#x2019; or &#x2018;prepare a haggis&#x2019;; the latter could be accompanied by a helping of wahisah, &#x2018;a dish made of locusts and grease&#x2019;, and washed down byadasiyah, an &#x2018;aromatized soup of lentils&#x2019; or &#x2018;bat-dung used as a medicine&#x2019;. Alkhan doubled for &#x2018;a rotten walnut&#x2019; and &#x2018;a stinking uncircumcised person&#x2019;. The sounds of Dictionary Land included inqad, &#x2018;the squeaking of eagles/the noise of fingers being cracked/the smacking of lips to call goats&#x2019; or even &#x2018;the noise made by truffles being extracted&#x2019;. The truffles might be of a species called faswat al-dab&#x2019;, also the name for a kind of poppy and, rendered literally, &#x2018;the noiseless flatulence of a male hyena&#x2019;.</p><p>Somebody once said that every Arabic word means itself, its opposite or a camel.* But to me the world of the qamus, the dictionary (or &#x2018;ocean&#x2019;), was even more bizarre. To do it justice called for the descriptive faculties of the pre-Islamic poet Ta&#x2019;abbata Sharra, whose name means He Who Carried An Evil Under His Armpit. And this dictionary was a shadow of Lane&#x2019;s, which in ten folio volumes over a period of thirty-four years only got as far as the letter qaf. Lane&#x2019;s was based on works like The Bridal Tiara of al-Zabidi, the great Yemeni-educated lexicographer and a contemporary of Dr Johnson. As a small boy I used to stare for hours at the fanciful oriental watercolours on my grandmother&#x2019;s walls; dreamed recurringly of flying over desert encampments in a telephone box; was shown, by my father, a strange, misshapen red globule which he produced from his bureau and said was the blood of an Arabian dragon. Now, out of these pages, the exotic beckoned once more, and I was hooked.</p><p>The door opened. I turned round, expecting to see a black woolly face, or a Person from Porlock; but it was Roddy, the person from next door. He had been out gathering his flock and was soaked. A bottle stuck out of his poacher&#x2019;s pocket.</p><p>&#x2018;Och, you&#x2019;ve let the fire burn out.&#x2019; He looked briefly at the dictionary, sighed and snapped it shut. &#x2018;Let&#x2019;s have a drop of the Grouse.&#x2019;</p><p>The vision was not shattered &#x2013; just temporarily blurred. Time and again in the years that followed, some verbal curiosity or weirdness of phrase would sidetrack me out of the corridors of the Oxford Oriental Institute and back into Dictionary Land.</p><p>&#x2018;I didn&#x2019;t get the drift of lines 66&#x2013;7. Could you, er ...?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018; &#x201c;Verily I have seen upon your mandibles the belly- and tail-fat of a lizard./ Your words reveal the buttocks of your meanings.&#x201d; &#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m sorry?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018; &#x201c;Your words reveal the buttocks of your meanings.&#x201d; &#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Oh.&#x2019;</p><p>They taught us abstruse and arcane mysteries, how to compound the base elements of syntax into glittering and highly wrought prose. We were apprentices in a linguistic alchemy. And, like alchemy, Arabic seemed to be half science and two-thirds magic. The Arabs themselves are spellbound by their language. Look at the effect on them of the Qur&#x2019;an: the Word &#x2013; divinely beautiful, terrifying, tear-inducing, spine-tingling, mesmerizing, inimitable &#x2013; was sufficient in itself. It did not need to become flesh. But Qur&#x2019;anic Arabic is only one manifestation of the language. You can be preacher, poet, raconteur and fishwife in a single sentence. You can, with the Arabic of official reports, say next to nothing in a great many words and with enormous elegance. You can compose a work of literature on the two lateral extremities of the wrist-bone. You can even be cured of certain ailments by procuring a magic chit, infusing the ink out of it, and drinking the water: word-power at its most literal. They taught us all this, but they didn&#x2019;t teach us how to speak it. After two years of Arabic I couldn&#x2019;t even have asked the way to the lavatory.</p><p>My tutor spun round from his computer screen. &#x2018;Yemen? Why do you want to go there?&#x2019;</p><p>It must have been a shock. Usually only a truly major disaster, a wrong case-ending or a misplaced definite article, would unstick him from his corpus of Andalusian erotic verse.</p><p>&#x2018;I ... I met a Yemeni who said Yemeni Arabic was the closest dialect to Classical.&#x2019;</p><p>He smiled a painfully long smile like the rictus on a ventriloquist&#x2019;s dummy. &#x2018;They all say that, you stupid boy. Yemen.&#x2019; His mouth puckered around the word as if it were some disagreeably bitter fruit. Lemon. &#x2018;Why don&#x2019;t you go somewhere respectable ... Cairo, Amman, Tunis?&#x2019;</p><p>Cairo was out, a bedlam of smog, smugness and touts where the last Wonder of the World was disintegrating under acid rain and tourists&#x2019; feet. Amman, I had been told, was the most boring city in the Arab world. Tunis was, well, complex�e.</p><p>In fact I&#x2019;d lied. I&#x2019;d never knowingly set eyes on a real live Yemeni. But I felt that my tutor would find the true reason for my demanding a sabbatical in Yemen even less palatable. Some years before, the Museum of Mankind in London had recreated a corner of the market of San&#x2019;a, the Yemeni capital, as part of Britain&#x2019;s World of Islam Festival. Yards from Piccadilly was a secret, labyrinthine microcosm of the suq. Even its sounds and smells were reproduced. The swiftness of transposition was unreal, although little more so than the ten-hour flight from London to San&#x2019;a. The exhibition wasn&#x2019;t Yemen, but over the years it became a Yemen of the imagination which I peopled with faces seen in books: faces which were proud but not arrogant, grave but not severe, delicate but not weak, their eyes intensified by kohl and calligraphic eyebrows.</p><p>My reading revealed that others, too, had been bewitched by Yemen. &#x2018;Never&#x2019;, wrote one medieval visitor, &#x2018;have I seen glances more penetrating than those of the Yemenis. When they look at you, they dive into you ...&#x2019; Many references, however, were hardly complimentary. Yemen was seen as at best a backwater, more usually as backward. For example, a Yemeni who had been extolling his country at court in eighth-century Baghdad was attacked thus: &#x2018;What are you Yemenis? I&#x2019;ll tell you. You&#x2019;re nothing but tanners of hides, weavers of striped shirting, trainers of monkeys and riders of nags. You were drowned by a rat and ruled by a woman, and people had never even heard of Yemen until a hoopoe told them about it!&#x2019;* I was not put off. My first glimpse of Yemen had been at far too impressionable an age.</p><p>Besides, Yemen &#x2013; the Yemen I was seeing at second hand &#x2013; had something of Dictionary Land about it: as well as the talking hoopoes and dambusting rodents, men chewed leaves and camels lived on fish; they (the men) wore pinstriped lounge-suit jackets on top, skirts below, and wicked curved daggers in the middle; the cities seemed to have been baked, not built, of iced gingerbread; Yemen was part of Arabia but the landscape looked like ... well, nowhere else on Earth, and definitely not Arabia.</p><p>In the end my tutor relented, even gave me his blessing &#x2013; though he warned me not to be away too long. So I set out to explore Dictionary Land on the ground; and perhaps, eventually, to understand the people who lived in it.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve been there ever since.</p><p><b>1</b></p><p>Hard by Heaven</p><p>&#x2018;Thou coveredst it with the deep like as with a garment: the waters stand in the hills.&#x2019;</p><p>Psalm 104, v.3</p><p>LONG AGO, shortly after the waters of the Flood had begun to recede and the Himalayas, the Andes and the Alps were still islands on the face of the deep, some two-thirds of the way along a line from Everest to Kilimanjaro and just inside the Tropic of Cancer, a few eddies marked Arabia&#x2019;s re-entry into the world.</p><p>It was not a dramatic rebirth &#x2013; the Mountain of the Prophet Shu&#x2019;ayb is an unremarkable hump. Shu&#x2019;ayb himself was still seventeen generations off; by his time mankind would be back to its wicked old ways. But for the moment it was a clean start, the world an empty stage.</p><p>Enter Sam. Sam ibn Nuh, or Shem the son of Noah, knew that the future of humanity lay in his loins and in those of his brothers Ham and Yafith. He was to beget and give his name to the entire Semitic race: perhaps it was the weight of this awesome responsibility which, the medieval traveller Ibn al-Mujawir says, he wished to alleviate by finding a place &#x2018;with light water and a temperate healthy climate&#x2019;. This stony and windswept mountain would not do, but 4,500 feet below and half a day&#x2019;s journey to the south-east was a plain ringed by rocky peaks, where the flood had left a rich layer of silt.</p><p>This was the spot. Sam bounded down the mountain and pegged out a foundation trench, only to have his guideline stolen by a bird. The bird flew off with the line and dropped it on the east side of the plain. To Sam, this was a clear sign. So it was there, on the future site of the Palace of Ghumdan, under the rising of Taurus with Venus and Mars in conjunction, that he came to build the world&#x2019;s first city: San&#x2019;a.</p><p>Elsewhere, the receding floodwater had revealed a chain of mountains running from north to south, broken by occasional hollows and plateaux where, as in the plain of San&#x2019;a, alluvial deposits would attract settlers. To the west and south the mountains ended abruptly in jagged escarpments overlooking plains; the plains lay just above sea-level and were hot and sticky but more fertile still. Eastwards, the mountains shelved into a desert which, even when Sam&#x2019;s progeny had multiplied, would remain empty except for outlaws and oilmen. Far to the south-east and close to the desert&#x2019;s fringe was a deep scar of a valley, hemmed in by barren steppes, where one of Sam&#x2019;s descendants would settle, giving it his nickname Hadramawt &#x2013; Death Has Come.</p><p>So the veil was drawn back from the rucked-up corner of Arabia called Yemen, being on the right side,yamin, of the Ka&#x2019;bah of Mecca; or because it is blessed with yumn, felicity; or after Yamin the brother of Hadramawt.</p><p>All this, some say, is nonsense. Around the beginning of the Christian era San&#x2019;a grew from an outpost where the road from Marib, capital of the ancient kingdom of Saba, meets the watershed; Hadramawt is just another pre-Arabic name, the traditional etymology a fanciful back-projection; Yemen, al-yaman, simply means &#x2018;the south&#x2019;.</p><p>The truth is that Yemen&#x2019;s distant past is still obscure. Archaeology has hardly begun to come up with solid facts. Early Yemeni historians, though, produced their own interpretation using genealogy. At the base of the family tree comes Sam. Higher up is Sam&#x2019;s great-grandson, the Prophet Hud. Hud&#x2019;s son Qahtan is...</p></p><h2>On the Grace of God</h2><p><p>Why is grace such a big deal?</p> <p>What does God tell us about it in Scripture? Can radical grace really be true?

Her father was a successful builder who played an important role in developing their hometown of Bronderslev.<br> Lydia became a teacher in the state school system of Denmark and was a pioneer in the field of home economics. By 1925 she had obtained a post as director of home economics in a large new school in the town of Korsor. While seeking more meaning for her life, she started reading the Bible and received a vision of Jesus Christ that led to her salvation and baptism in the Holy Spirit. After months of earnest prayer and waiting upon God, she became convinced that God was asking her to give up her position as a teacher and go to Jerusalem in the tumultuous days before Israel became a nation.<br> In October 1928, at the age of thirty&#x2013;eight, she set out for Jerusalem with about $200 in traveler's checks, no mission or church to support her, and no idea of what she was to do when she arrived. She soon established herself there, learned Arabic, and founded a children's home, becoming the cherished "mother" to dozens of Jewish and Arab orphans, mainly girls, eight of whom became her own children. She also began ministering the gospel to Arab women and later to the British soldiers who visited Jerusalem during their furloughs in World War II.<br> In the mid&#x2013;1940s, she met and married Derek Prince, a philosophy and language scholar who was serving in the British army and was stationed in Jerusalem. They ministered there together until the birth of the State of Israel in 1948 when they moved to England with their eight girls.<br> The Princes served congregations, taught, and ministered while living in England, Africa (where they adopted their ninth daughter), Canada, and the United States. After settling in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, they began traveling internationally as Derek preached and taught the Bible in many nations of the world. Throughout these years, Lydia took care of their family, worked tirelessly and faithfully alongside Derek in their ministry, and even returned to her home economics roots when they were in Africa, teaching home economics to the African women students.<br> Following a stroke and a two&#x2013;year illness, Lydia Prince died in October 1975. Her passing was deeply mourned by her family and thousands of people worldwide from a wide variety of backgrounds whose lives she had touched in her nearly fifty years of enthusiastic, energetic, and compassionate ministry.<br></p><h2>Crystal Healing For Beginners: Discover The Healing Power Of Crystals And Healing Stones To Heal The Human Energy Field, Relieve Stress and Experience Instant Relaxation</h2><p><p><b> CRYSTAL HEALING FOR BEGINNERS 4th EDITION: Discover The Healing Power Of Crystals And Healing Stones To Heal The Human Energy Field, Relieve Stress and Experience Instant Relaxation !</b></p> <p><i><b> Do you want a comprehensible guide on crystals?</b></i></p> <p><i><b>Are you curious what crystals all can do?</b></i></p> <p><i><b>No need to look any further !</b></i></p> <p>Healing Crystals is a well-rounded introduction to the importance and use of different crystals.

In response, the renowned Colombian artist Fernando Botero created a series of riveting paintings and drawings that constitute an acerbic condemnation of man&#39;s inhumanity to man. The 73-year-old artist, drawing on his knowledge of Renaissance art, has produced a body of works that is timely yet timeless, a vision of hell on earth belonging to a noble tradition of artistic statements against war and violence that includes Goya&#39;s Disasters of War and Picasso&#39;s Guernica, the works of the Mexican muralists, and Botero&#39;s own 1990s paintings responding to drug violence in Colombia.</p><p>Born in Medellin, Colombia, in 1932, Fernando Botero studied in Madrid and Florence, learning the Fresco techniques of the Italian masters, and Mexico City where he encountered the work of the muralists Rivera, Orozco, and Siqueiros.

Wadsworth, whose children's biographies include accounts of John Muir and Rachel Carson, has adapted Russell's memoirs of the tumultuous journey, which were transcribed by her daughter in the 1920s. As she explains in a foreword, Wadsworth preserved Marion's "eloquent voice" as much as possible. Her flowing first-person narrative contains lovely descriptive passages ("The vast open country that is gone from us forever rippled like a silver sea in the sunshine"), as well as such engaging particulars as Russell's frustration at not being able to reach all the buttons in the back of her dress ("Why couldn't they have been put in front where I could get at them?"). Watling's art pays similar attention to period details. Whether depicting a glorious sunset on the plains or the bustling streets of Santa Fe, his polished colored ink and colored pencil pictures are historically accurate and filled with energy. Ages 7-11. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.Grade 2-3-Wadsworth has adapted Russell's memoirs of traveling as part of a wagon train in 1851 on the Santa Fe Trail from Kansas, with her widowed mother and her brother, headed for California. The narrative shows the child's daily routine as she comments on the sights and stops along the way, the weather, the lack of water, the animals they encountered, and the hostile and friendly Indians. The flowing text is complemented by Watling's evocative paintings of placid buffalo, the wagon train in a storm, and the bustle of Santa Fe. Unexpectedly, the trip doesn't end in California, but in Albuquerque, after Marion's mother's money and jewels are stolen and she is unable to pay for the rest of the journey. A route map is provided, as is an afterword explaining what happened to Marion and her family and friends.

Earlier in his life some gentleman in a pin-striped suit looking like Rico Bandello or Michael Corleone would have bumped him off.&nbsp; Big shots don&#x2019;t like to get robbed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I once met Titanic. That&#x2019;s the big news in this effort.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#x2019;d heard most of the stories growing up, and every article I&#x2019;ve ever read about Titanic was written by someone who never knew him personally. But I&#x2019;m not faulting them for it. A lot of people who never knew Napoleon have written about him. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who have rhapsodized Titanic in print were understandably intrigued with the legend and all of the outlandish gambling stories attached to him, many of them helped along by the man himself, along with the stunts and tricks he performed, or supposedly did, to fleece the unwitting in a more na�ve era.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tales about him were hard to resist. He was indeed an accomplished professional gambler as well as a hustler, and those are two different things. There is solid testimony from people who did know him that he was an excellent golfer, card player, pool shark, and skeet shooter. The rest is up for grabs.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was 14 when I first heard about Titanic. So did every kid in Texas who spent any time around golf courses. The club pros usually told the stories and pretended to know him, and some did know him, and they were prone to embellish the stories if that was needed to hold your interest.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believed he could throw an orange or a lemon over a five-story building---I<br> assumed he had an arm like Dizzy Dean. Of course, I later learned the orange or lemon was weighted down with lead. I never believed he could throw a brass key into a door lock from across a hotel room. That defied logic. But I did believe he could throw a bunch of quarters into a snuff can from 30 feet away without missing. At a young age I was willing to believe, if not hopeful, that he had dated movie stars like Jean Harlow, Joan Blondell, Glenda Farrell, and Myrna Loy.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a lot of romance in the stories about Alvin C. Thomas, which was his real name. Alvin Clarence Thomas of Rogers, Arkansas, by way of his birthplace, a small town in Missouri.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I never believed he could knock a bird off a telephone wire by hitting a golf ball at it with a four-wood. I wasn&#x2019;t that gullible. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I found out how he did it if a wager was involved. Ti would drop a ball on the ground and take out his four-wood, waggle it, and pretend to aim at the bird on the wire. When some sucker would bet him he couldn&#x2019;t do it, Ti would pull out a gun he carried and shoot the bird off the wire.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Years later I realized Ti could do some of the things I&#x2019;d heard about because I saw others do it. Bob Rosburg, for example, could sail 52 cards out of a deck, one by one, into a hat from a good distance away in a locker room.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And this day and time almost any college golfer can bounce a golf ball on the face of a sand wedge 50 times or more without missing. These days it&#x2019;s what a college golfer practices in the dorm instead of studying.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My first long-distance call from Titanic Thompson came in March of 1970. He was then living in Grapevine, Texas, which is near Fort Worth and Dallas. I was living in Manhattan and writing for <i>Sports Illustrated.</i> The call came to my office in the <i>Time-Life</i> Building. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I let Titanic know how delighted I was to be speaking with a legend, after<br> which he told me how rich we were going to be when I wrote his story for a movie or a book. All he wanted was a million dollars up front. Just a million. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the saying goes, I may not be smart, but I&#x2019;m not stupid. I was aware<br> that I couldn&#x2019;t possibly be the first person Titanic---&#x201c;Call me Ti&#x201d;---had ever approached with the project. I must have been far down the list, or he would have sold it by this particular time in history. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was also busy. Not only with my magazine assignments on the road, but I was working on a novel, which happened to be <i>Semi-Tough.</i> Still, I didn&#x2019;t want to blow him off altogether. I told him I would ask around, talk to my agent, try to see if his story could &#x201c;gain any traction in the marketplace,&#x201d; to use agent-speak, and we would chat again another day.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which we did. A week later. When he called to try to stoke my interest by rolling his credits as a folklore character. I heard how he had set up the poker game at which Arnold Rothstein, a crime boss, was murdered in New York City. How he won a bundle off Howard Hughes at Lakeside Golf Club. How he took on other&nbsp; Hollywood folks on the golf course and &#x201c;picked &#x2018;em like a chickens.&#x201d; How he had skinned that &#x201c;big fraud,&#x201d; John Montague, at Lakeside. How he&#x2019;d dated all those Myrna Loys in Hollywood in the early Thirties.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That last bit of info probably didn&#x2019;t need questioning---it evidently wasn&#x2019;t that hard to do. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This requires a brief interruption, a skip forward by 15 years. Through a mutual friend, as it happened, my wife and I were invited to have dinner with Myrna Loy---and drinks afterward in her Manhattan apartment. A swell time was had by all. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Myrna Loy was friendly and charming, and well-preserved for a lady in her<br> &#x2018;80s. I had adored her on the screen as Nora Charles in all of the &#x201c;Thin Man&#x201d;<br> movies, and even more as Milly, the wife of Frederic March, in &#x201c;The Best Years of<br> Our Lives.&#x201d; She made over 80 films. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At some point during the evening I asked her if she had ever known or gone<br> out with a man named Titanic Thompson in her early days. I explained who he was, and that he was well-known in certain circles. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said, &#x201c;I was making a movie every six weeks in those days, working constantly. But I did have a free night now and then. What a wonderful name. Was he handsome?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said, &#x201c;According to lore. Tall guy, elegant dresser.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; she said with a sparkle. &#x201c;I hope he took me to the Brown Derby.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I told Titanic I would be in Fort Worth in May for the Colonial tournament and two or three days afterward, to visit with relatives. Maybe we could get together. I wanted to meet the notorious figure in the flesh. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was 78 years old then, dividing his time between Tenison Park in Dallas and Meadowbrook in Fort Worth, two public golf courses where gentlemen of sporting blood gathered. He still fancied wagers. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I let him know I&#x2019;d be staying at the Green Oaks Inn in Fort Worth. He said he&#x2019;d call me there and we could arrange to meet.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Titanic Thompson I found at Meadowbrook was a thin, white-haired man roughly six feet tall. He was wearing a long-sleeve alpaca sweater over a golf shirt, a pair of tan slacks, and a red ball cap.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I broke the news to him that I couldn&#x2019;t find any interest in a book or a movie. The book people had never heard of him, which didn&#x2019;t surprise me. The movie people said &#x201c;Guys and Dolls&#x201d; had covered the subject of gambling, and a golf movie didn&#x2019;t yell money at them. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did tell him that <i>SI </i>would be interested in an article. He could collaborate<br> with a writer on our staff, and the magazine would pay him a fee of some sort.<br> He said he would give it some thought. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thing I wanted to hear about the most was his side of the legend-filled match he played against a young Byron Nelson in Fort Worth, but I led up to it with questions about other things.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said, &#x201c;You mentioned John Montague on the phone. You said &#x2018;Golf&#x2019;s Mystery Man&#x2019; was a fraud?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ti said, &#x201c;The biggest mystery to me was how he ever got famous. He could hit a long drive, but he couldn&#x2019;t break 75. Heck, if you gave me two strokes a hole, I could beat you with a baseball bat and a rake and putting with my shoe. He got all he wanted of me in one day at Lakeside. But the middle 70s was all he needed to shoot to beat those Hollywood people with low handicaps they couldn&#x2019;t play to. Except for Howard Hughes. Howard was a good golfer. He worked hard at the game. He took lessons. Howard wanted to win the National Amateur more than he wanted to make movies. But he was never that good.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said, &#x201c;Your reputation came in handy, didn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It did when my name got around,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I come to find out there were a lot of people who wanted to lose to Titanic Thompson. It gave &#x2018;em a story to tell their friends. I took advantage of that.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Golf was the game you were best at?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I was good at cards, too. I never cheated at cards. I played straight up. I could read cards and I could read people. I mostly played poker, but I could play any old card game. Fan Tan, Crazy Eight, Gin Rummy. Gin was starting to catch on back in the Thirties, but not everywhere, and not like today.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said, &#x201c;Gin was too slow, right? For a gambling man?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You could say that.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to hear about his name. I&#x2019;d read that he adopted &#x201c;Thompson&#x201d; when<br> he saw his name misprinted in a newspaper.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Titanic Thompson does have a better ring to it than Titanic Thomas,&#x201d; I said as a comment, not a question.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He nodded. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As lore had it, he got the name Titanic as a young man before World War One in a pool hall in Joplin, Missouri. But I said I found it hard to buy that he got it by jumping over a pool table, or diving over a pool table, or whatever else he&#x2019;d let people believe. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He said, &#x201c;I did get the name in a pool game in Joplin, Missouri, before the war. A man named Snow Clark gave it to me. We were in a big game of pocket pool. Snow and me were partners against two other fellers. The stakes got pretty high. Snow saw me miss a couple of shots I should have made, and he knew it takes as much skill to miss a shot intentionally as it does to make it. He thought I&#x2019;d put him in the can---that I&#x2019;d bet on the other side. That&#x2019;s when he said, &#x2018;Boy, you&#x2019;re sinkin&#x2019; me like the Titanic.&#x2019; I started laughing. I knew he&#x2019;d given me a great name.&#x201d;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take that version,&#x201d; I said. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In years past I&#x2019;d talked to both Ben Hogan and Byron Nelson about Titanic. Each said he possessed a fine golf swing and was a hell of a player. Hogan also said, &#x201c;Only a fool would play him in a game he suggested.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I brought up the match between Titanic Thompson and Byron Nelson. It wasn&#x2019;t covered by the press, and was never written about, but it became a part of Fort Worth golf history. They played an 18-hole match for $1,000---winner take all---in 1931 at Ridglea Golf Club on the west side of town. Ridglea was a public course then, but since 1954 it has been a country club of prominence.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One grand was big money in those days. It would be the equivalent of about&nbsp; <br> $14,000 today in terms of buying or shopping power.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ti was in town and all of the public courses were gambling haunts back then. He dropped by Ridglea and let it be known that he wanted to play &#x201c;the best man in town&#x201d; for a thousand dollars. Word reached a member at Glen Garden Country Club, where Byron was a junior member. This was a year before Byron turned pro. He was the best amateur around the area then. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The member at Glen Garden liked games of chance, and rounded up two other investors. They backed Nelson in the match. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter Byron&#x2019;s memory of the event: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I never gambled at golf in my life, and I didn&#x2019;t want to be a part of it. I don&#x2019;t really remember who the backers were. A Mr. Brown was involved, but that&#x2019;s the only name I recall. Mr. Brown said not to worry about the money. All I had to do was play my best golf---they were taking the risk.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well, of course, I enjoyed competition. I wanted to play my best. About a dozen people followed us. I was nervous and bogied two holes and fell behind, but I played well on the ba...</p></p><h2>Enon: A Novel (ALA Notable Books for Adults)</h2><p><b><b>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST NOVELS OF THE YEAR BY</b><br> <b><i>The Wall Street Journal � </i>American Library Association<i> � Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br>A stunning allegorical novel about one man&#x2019;s enduring love for his daughter</b><br><br>Hailed as &#x201c;a masterpiece&#x201d; (NPR), <i>Tinkers, </i>Paul Harding&#x2019;s Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning debut, is a modern classic. <i>The Dallas Morning News</i> observed that &#x201c;like Faulkner, Harding never shies away from describing what seems impossible to put into words.&#x201d; Here, in <i>Enon,</i> Harding follows a year in the life of Charlie Crosby as he tries to come to terms with a shattering personal tragedy.

And so, with Flake, his only friend, he contends with clique upon clique&#x2014;the jocks who pummel them, the girls who ignore or taunt them&#x2014;as well as the dogged and disconcerting attentions of a sixth-grader who&#x2019;s even more ferociously disaffected than they are.

In the wash. I have one pair of pants that aren&#x2019;t clown pants and they&#x2019;re in the wash. They haven&#x2019;t been washed all summer but today, this morning, they&#x2019;re in the wash. It&#x2019;s too cold for cargoes and everything else in my drawer is Queer Nation, and sure enough I&#x2019;m the only one on the bus in shorts. &#x201c;Scorcher, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; a ninth-grader asks when he goes by my locker. I&#x2019;m standing there like I&#x2019;m modeling beachwear. Kids across the hall chuckle and point. I almost head home right then.<br><br>&#x201c;FS, man,&#x201d; Flake says when he sees my face.<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t take it,&#x201d; I tell him. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like, twenty minutes, and I can&#x2019;t take it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Look at your face,&#x201d; he says, and he has to laugh. He doesn&#x2019;t mean it in a bad way.<br><br>I put my head on my hands in my locker and try to tear the shelf off the wall.<br><br>&#x201c;FS,&#x201d; he says. At least our first period classes are near each other.<br><br>&#x201c;FS,&#x201d; I tell him back. We don&#x2019;t even have homeroom together, though they told us over the summer we would. FS is fuckin&#x2019; school. We argue over who thought of it.<br><br>My homeroom teacher has a big banner up on the bulletin board that says welcome to eighth grade! Underneath it there&#x2019;s a sign that says leave no child unsuccessful and a handout for &#x201c;eight ways of being smart.&#x201d;<br><br>In the doorway of first-period English my feet like freeze. I can&#x2019;t even get into the room. I will not fucking do this, I think to myself. &#x201c;What?&#x201d; the English teacher says.<br><br>We&#x2019;re not in the same gym class, either. And his is fourth period and the first day stuff runs long, so there I am in the cafeteria without him. C&#x2019;mon, c&#x2019;mon, c&#x2019;mon, I go to myself, like some god&#x2019;ll say, &#x201c;Oh sorry, Hanratty, you want your only friend? I&#x2019;ll send him along.&#x201d;<br><br>And who&#x2019;s there: Hogan, Weensie, and all the other buttwipes who are always after me. The kid from Darien we call Dickhead who beat me with a plank last spring. He pulled it from his tree house, and his friends held me down. Flake said when he saw my back that I was lucky there were no nails in it.<br><br>&#x201c;Look who&#x2019;s watching his figure,&#x201d; the kid goes. I have like one milk pint on my tray.<br><br>&#x201c;Eat me,&#x201d; I tell him. My eyes are tearing up and I want to pull them out and pound each of them flat on the tray.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not sittin&#x2019; on this side,&#x201d; the kid says.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll sit where I want,&#x201d; I tell him. But I stand there and then head across the room away from him. I want to set fire to every single fixture and chair and window and crappy water-stained ceiling tile in this cafeteria. I can never eat anything here. Just taking a sip of water makes me want to hurl.<br><br>I&#x2019;d fight if it was just him. But he&#x2019;s got eight thousand friends. Every asshole in the school is his friend.<br><br>I&#x2019;m standing there with my tray. Pint of milk and a Rice Krispies Treat in a little dish. Every table&#x2019;s worse than the one next to it. It&#x2019;s the worst feeling in the world.<br><br>When you&#x2019;re standing there in the middle of the floor with no one to eat with, there are about four kids who don&#x2019;t look at you. The cafeteria holds three hundred.<br><br>&#x201c;Nice shorts,&#x201d; somebody says.<br><br>Even if you don&#x2019;t eat, you have to just stay until lunch is over anyway. There&#x2019;s a spot next to a kid from Latvia or Lithuania or something who smells. She has her hair moussed and smashed onto one side of her head like she fell asleep in tree sap. She showed up last year. She has fewer friends than Flake and me. And we only have each other.<br><br>&#x201c;Is this seat taken?&#x201d; I go.<br><br>&#x201c;I yev a fren coming,&#x201d; she says.<br><br>I end up next to a girl who has to be the most beautiful person in her zip code.

A highly readable general biography of the American icon, complete with realistic replicas of notes, sketches and letters from the Presidential collection, this book will delight Lincoln enthusiasts, as well as fans of general American history. Wills' text is a well-written account of Lincoln's life, with nods to all of the recent scholarship-from Doris Kearns Goodwin's 2005 Team of Rivals to recent speculation over Lincoln's sexual orientation-without sinking into too much analysis or debate. Photos, portraits and engravings abound (though, chronologically, they're occasionally at odds with the text), and a dozen vellum envelopes bound into the book hold historic reproductions, including a leaf from Lincoln's school notebook, an 1860 presidential campaign banner and his handwritten copy of the Emancipation Proclamation. Though a bit gimmicky, these replicas do provide unique insight into the man's elusive life; holding a letter from an impatient Mary Todd that begins, "I have waited in vain to hear from you... but will be charitable enough to impute your silence to the right cause," one can almost hear the President's exasperated sigh as he turns to his writing desk. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Here too are tender lyrics about family, lovers, and friends; celebrations of the natural and domestic worlds of upstate New York; and remarkably vivid letters home from spiritual sojourns through Italy, Germany, and the former Yugoslavia. &#34;Vega&#39;s poems reflect a deeply felt and aching knowledge,&#34; wrote Publishers Weekly of her previous collection. &#34;They &#39;go&#39; (as Kerouac said) their own patient, unadorned, and dignified way.&#34;</p><p>The author of 14 books of poems, including the selected Mad Dogs of Trieste (2000), Vega is the director of Incisions/Arts, a program that brings writers into prisons to lead poetry workshops. Some of the poems in this volume were written at the Eastern Correctional Facility in Napanoch, New York: they have the immediacy and directness of lineated prose, as in a poem on so-called "Driving While Black" legislation: "Police/ largely/ oppose the bill/ insisting it would/ create an undue burden/ on law enforcement officers/ and wouldn't necessarily prove a thing." Other poems meditate on relationships, writerly and otherwise, or take stock of a difficult writing life (one ends: "I ain't dead yet"). This book doesn't contain Vega's strongest work, but it serves as kind of poetic diary of justice and of witness as sought through language. In a poem from the title section, which ends the book, the speaker sums up the scale at which it happens: "I'm reading your poems/ and a huge ramshackle building appears, the light from a hundred candles/ spills out on the snow." <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His job, his marriage, even his children all feel disconnected and distant. Has he really accomplished nothing of consequence in his life? One Christmas Day, Travis plays a round of golf and finds himself for the first time in the zone--playing like a pro. In astonishingly short order, Travis is catapulted into the PGA Senior Open at Pebble Beach, where he advances to the final round. And while his wife, his children, and a live television audience watch, a miracle takes place that changes Travis, and his family, forever.<i> </i></p><p>James Patterson has had more <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers than any other writer, ever, according to <i>Guinness World Records</i>.

He writes full-time and lives in Florida with his family.<br>While it isn't quite the literary equivalent of a hole-in-one, this fast-moving golf fantasy about an amateur golfer who decides to try out for the PGA Senior Tour has enough sweetness and humor to overcome its obvious plot cliches. Middle-aged and happily married, Travis McKinley does the unthinkable: he misses Christmas dinner after getting caught up in a divinely inspired streak of great putting during an outing on the country club course in Winnetka, Ill. As Travis's obsession with his newfound talent takes over his life, his obstetrician wife, Sarah, expresses increasing dismay over his inability to grow up, a domestic crisis that reaches a boiling point when Travis loses his job and journeys to Tallahassee, Fla., to try to qualify for the Senior Tour. Competing against overwhelming odds, Travis earns a place on the tour, only to have his dream spoiled when he learns that Sarah intends to file for divorce. As he continues to compete against the likes of Jack Nicklaus and Lee Trevino, the victory that will fulfill Travis's dream and reunite him with his family is as improbable as it is inevitable. Plot issues aside, Patterson (whose newest thriller is Jack and Jill) and de Jonge succeed admirably in creating a winning character who is enough of a child to believe his dreams and is also mature enough to offer some gently humorous reflections on our national obsession with an engaging sport.

You know that if you die tonight, you'll go to heaven. But Todd Hunter believes Christianity is a <em>life,</em> not merely a secure death. Which means that eternal life--abundant life--begins on earth, as soon as we become a follower of Jesus. Drawing from his leadership and ministry experience as president of Alpha USA and from his own study and life experiences as an ordinary Christian, Hunter calls us to reframe our salvation and discipleship to focus on life, instead of just heaven and hell. God's intention, he says, is for us to become God's cooperative friends, seeking to live consistent lives of creative goodness for the sake of others. These pages lead us into this abundant way of living, offering <ul> <li>the whole scope of God's story and how you fit into that</li> <li>guidance on the Holy Spirit's role and power in your life</li> <li>creative ways to love, serve and respond to seeking friends</li> <li>help for starting a "Three Is Enough" small group</li> </ul> Jesus came that we might have life--not just in heaven, but here on earth where he walked and lived among us. And your friends who are hurting, hopeless or hungry for something real need to see what difference life in Christ makes. This timely, biblical paradigm from Todd Hunter will inspire and equip you to live your days with intention, participating in God's work in the world today. It just might change the way you look at life forever.</p><p>&#34;Todd Hunter has provided a concrete and practical strategy for twenty-first-century Christian living and witness. He rethinks central concepts of Christian life in terms of contemporary experience, but ties them solidly to biblical teachings and the history of Christ&#39;s people. Best of all, what he says to do is congruent with where the Holy Spirit is moving in our times and can be verified in experience. Put it to the test and you will find that a lot of &#39;Christian stuff&#39; that never worked for you before actually does work. One just has to get to the reality of it, which Hunter does.&#34;Visit Todd Hunter&#39;s website.</p><h2>Maverick Heart (Lone Star Legends V2)</h2><p>Nurse Levee O'Reilly and her husband, Dr. Liam O'Reilly, are headed west to the California Territory to practice medicine when their stagecoach is tragically attacked by the infamous Frank Michaels.

Marriage is far from the top of his to&#x2013;do list, and he aims to keep it that way.<br> <br> When a coincidental meeting brings Levee and Dan together, they're awakened to a long ignored desire for love and acceptance by the realization that they might have finally found it.

Levee, who has also suffered two miscarriages, begins life again in the small border town of Eagle Pass, teaching school and catching the eye of rancher Dan Neville, one of the large Neville clan. Dan's limp is only the tip of a backstory that makes the rancher feel unworthy of Levee, one of the first women in the country to obtain a nursing degree.

It is both a cultural and political portrait of the Austrian capital and a biography of Hitler during his years there, from 1906 to 1913. Hitler's was not the modern, artistic "fin-de-si�cle Vienna" we associate with Freud, Mahler, and Wittgenstein. Instead, it was a cauldron of fear and ethnic rivalry and a breeding ground for racist political theories. Brigitte Hamann vividly depicts the undercurrent of disturbing ideologies that flowed beneath the glitter of the Hapsburg capital. Drawing on previously untapped sources that range from personal reminiscences to the records of homeless shelters where the unemployed Hitler spent his nights, Hamann gives us the fullest account ever rendered of this period of Hitler's life and shows us how profoundly his years in Vienna influenced his later career.</p><p>&#34;Hamann paints a fascinating picture of the events and readings that shaped the young Hitler. Highly recommended.&#34;<br><strong>Brigitte Hamann</strong> is a Ph.D. and specialist in 19th and 20th-century history, specifically of Austrian history. She is the author of many books in German, some of which have been translated into English, including <em>The Reluctant Empress: A Biography of Empress Elisabeth of Austria</em> and <em>Bertha von</em> <em>Suttner.

Irene's first book, <em>Shattered Dreams</em>, is the staggering chronicle of her<em> </em>struggle to provide for her children in abject poverty and feelings of abandonment each time her husband left to be with one of his other wives. Irene was raised to believe polygamy was the way of life necessary for her ticket to heaven. <br><br>The hard knocks of her environment were just the beginning of Irene's shocking tale. Insanity ran rampant in her husband's family and was the source of inconceivable events that unfolded throughout Irene's adult life. CULT INSANITY takes readers deeper into her story to uncover the outrageous behavior of her brother-in-law Ervil -- a self-proclaimed prophet who determined he was called to set the house of God in order -- and how he terrorized their colony. Claiming to be God's avenger and to have a license to kill in the name of God, Ervil ordered the murders of friends and family members, eliminating all those who challenged his authority. <br><br>For those who were gripped by <em>Shattered Dreams</em>, the rest of the story will blow them away.

One of the aptitude exams it developed was the Belongings Test, in which candidates had to draw conclusions about a man based purely on items in his bedroom: clothes, a timetable, a ticket receipt. </p><p></p><p> Sam Gosling, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Texas at Austin, has made a career of studying how such clues illuminate personality. His premise is that our personalities seep out in everything we do and that expert snoopers can draw remarkably accurate pictures of us by examining the traces we leave behind. </p><p></p><p>Gosling's conclusions are supported by rigorous academic research, but his engaging book is aimed at a popular audience; he presents it as a field guide to the "special brand of voyeurism" he calls "snoopology." Few readers may actually rummage through their neighbors' garbage in search of what Gosling dryly calls "behavioral residue," but Snoop's conceit makes for an entertaining tour of how people project their inner selves outward into the world.</p><p></p><p>Some clues come from explicit, deliberate identity claims, like the Malcolm X poster on your wall or the crucifix over your bed. Others, like the songs you download or the coffee cup you throw away, are what psychologists call "seepage," messages that leak out beneath your notice. </p><p></p><p>The trick to decoding a person's space is knowing what to look for. Offices with plants, knick-knacks and symbols of friends, family and pets tend to belong to women; men display more sports items and symbols of their achievements. Rock fans are less friendly, more artistic and more anxious than fans of religious music. Extroverts offer comfortable chairs and bowls of candy as "bait" to lure people into their offices, while difficult people wind up on the remote fringes of the workplace.</p><p>This may seem like just common sense, but it's not. We think people with messy, disorganized bedrooms will be unpleasant, but we're wrong. We incorrectly assume people whose rooms are highly decorated and cluttered are more extroverted. We make similar errors in judging people directly: We expect timid, grumpy-looking people with weak voices and halting speech to be anxious and easily upset, and we expect self-assured, smiling, stylish people to be open, imaginative and curious. But neither expectation is accurate.</p><p></p><p>On a date or job interview, you may succeed in presenting a misleading impression of yourself. But since the gradual accumulation of clues in your living space is hard to fake, snooping can yield a penetrating portrait. And that, says Gosling, is perfectly okay, because though we try to put our best selves forward, most of us, in the end, want to be known not for who we wish we could be, but for who we are.</p><p></p><p>Of course, one of the main ways we carve out our identity is by consuming. We surround ourselves with things that reinforce our conception of who we are, purchasing not just the objects we need but also symbols that help us articulate our personal narratives. That's why Ramones T-shirts outsell Ramones albums 10 to one and why, Rob Walker asserts, 75 percent of Viking's ultra-high-end kitchen ranges are never used. </p><p></p><p> In Buying In, Walker, who writes a consumer behavior column for the New York Times Magazine, makes a startling claim: Far from being immune to advertising, as many people think, American consumers are increasingly active participants in the marketing process. True, we've grown skeptical of traditional advertising, the clumsy, crass kind in which someone on Madison Avenue thinks up a soft-drink jingle and broadcasts it into ubiquity. And it's true that TiVo and the Internet have given us more control over the advertisements we see. </p><p> But Walker leads readers through a series of lucid case studies to demonstrate that, in many cases, consumers actively participate in infusing a brand with meaning. Consider the iconic mouthless cat known as Hello Kitty, used for marketing clothes, toys and bandages by the Japanese company Sanrio. She has no personality because the company painstakingly avoids defining her character, Walker says. The key to the mega-brand's success, he suggests, is ensuring that Hello Kitty remains an ambiguous symbol, a blank slate on which buyers can inscribe whatever meaning they want, from nostalgia to camp to subversiveness. </p><p></p><p>For the same reason, the makers of Red Bull never claim anything specific about the highly caffeinated drink's special ingredient, taurine, or which powers of athleticism, mental acuity or virility it supposedly bestows. They prefer marketing campaigns that promote the brand's "personality" by sponsoring such extreme sporting events as kiteboarding to Cuba, kayaking over waterfalls and street luge.</p><p>Or consider how the Pabst Blue Ribbon brand was hijacked by young, anti-corporate types. PBR's fan base grew not from aggressive marketing, Walker says, but from the lack of it. Long neglected, PBR had virtually no image at all, which helped make it an underground darling among people who attached a blue-collar, honest-workingman, anti-capitalist ethos to the brand.</p><p></p><p> Walker's analysis breaks down in places. He can't fathom why people would pay more for a Viking range or an iPod when competing products are cheaper. Most iPod buyers have never heard of such features as "Smart Playlists" and thus, he concludes, do not understand "all the functions that they paid a premium to obtain" -- as if those functions, and not the device's sleek form, are what drew 100 million purchasers. He considers the notion that people can pay for aesthetic pleasure but then dismisses it, saying it sounds more like a "rationale" than a rational choice. He's likewise baffled by why anyone would buy Method's leaky but beautiful, hourglass-shaped bottle of dish soap. Since we don't parade around town impressing others with elegant cleaning products, there's no "purely rational defense" for buying one, he says, seemingly oblivious to the possibility that we can rationally spend money on aesthetic pleasures we will enjoy alone.</p><p></p><p>But his major argument is convincing: In this new era of participatory marketing, many brands' meanings -- once crafted and maintained from atop the peaks of corporate hierarchies -- now originate from consumers. We once feared an Orwellian future in which big, scary corporations secretly manipulated our thoughts and desires. But commercial influence has become an open-source project. "We have already met the new hidden persuaders," writes Walker, "and they are us." </p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

In this classic tale, a woman is reunited with the man she has loved for years&#x2014;and must reveal the secret that will jeopardize her chance for happiness at last. <br><br>He arrived out of the blue&#x2014;a flesh-and-blood phantom from the past in a sports car as sleek and sexy as Law Kincaid himself. The world-famous astronaut was as devastatingly attractive as the first time Marnie Hibbs had laid eyes on him, seventeen years before. But she well knew the perils of falling for a ladies&#x2019; man like Law. And this time she had someone besides herself to protect. Law is determined to discover who is sending him anonymous letters claiming he&#x2019;d fathered a son he knows nothing about. Showing up at the Hibbs&#x2019;s return address from the letters seemed like a step in the right direction. Marnie swears she isn&#x2019;t the guilty party, but when Law meets her son, it&#x2019;s like a one-two punch to his solar plexus. The boy is nearly the spitting image of Law. Law can&#x2019;t remember sleeping with Marnie&#x2014;then again, he can&#x2019;t remember much about his crazy past. But there&#x2019;s more to it than that: Marnie claims the boy isn&#x2019;t biologically hers. <br><br>As the tension between them becomes unbearable and the attraction undeniable, Marnie is forced to reveal a long-held secret...one that might cause her to lose both the boy she loves more than anyone&#x2014;and the man she desires more than anything.</p><p>Sandra Brown is the author of more than fifty <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers.

She and her family divide their time between South Carolina and Texas.1<br><br>The Porsche crept along the street like a sleek black panther. Hugging the curb, its engine purred so deep and low it sounded like a predator's growl.<br><br>Marnie Hibbs was kneeling in the fertile soil of her flower bed, digging among the impatiens under the ligustrum bushes and cursing the little bugs that made three meals a day of them, when the sound of the car's motor attracted her attention. She glanced at it over her shoulder, then panicked as it came to a stop in front of her house.<br><br>"Lord, is it that late?" she muttered. Dropping her trowel, she stood up and brushed the clinging damp earth off her bare knees.<br><br>She reached up to push her dark bangs off her forehead before she realized that she still had on her heavy gardening gloves. Quickly she peeled them off and dropped them beside the trowel, all the while watching the driver get out of the sports car and start up her front walk.<br><br>Glancing at her wristwatch, she saw that she hadn't lost track of time. He was just very early for their appointment, and as a result, she wasn't going to make a very good first impression. Being hot, sweaty, and dirty was no way to meet a client. And she needed this commission badly.<br><br>Forcing a smile, she moved down the sidewalk to greet him, nervously trying to remember if she had left the house and studio reasonably neat when she decided to do an hour's worth of yard work. She had planned to tidy up before he arrived.<br><br>She might look like the devil, but she didn't want to appear intimidated. Self-confident friendliness was the only way to combat the disadvantage of having been caught looking her worst.<br><br>He was still several yards away from her when she greeted him. "Hello," she said with a bright smile. "Obviously we got our signals switched. I thought you weren't coming until later."<br><br>"I decided this diabolical game of yours had gone on long enough."<br><br>Marnie's sneakers skidded on the old concrete walk as she came to an abrupt halt. She tilted her head in stunned surprise. "I'm sorry, I--"<br><br>"Who the hell are you, lady?"<br><br>"Miss Hibbs. Who do you think?"<br><br>"Never heard of you. Just what the devil are you up to?"<br><br>"Up to?" She glanced around helplessly, as though the giant sycamores in her front yard might provide an answer to this bizarre interrogation.<br><br>"Why've you been sending me those letters?"<br><br>"Letters?"<br><br>He was clearly furious, and her lack of comprehension only seemed to make him angrier. He bore down on her like a hawk on a field mouse, until she had to bow her back to look up at him. The summer sun was behind him, casting him in silhouette.<br><br>He was blond, tall, trim, and dressed in casual slacks and a sport shirt--all stylish, impeccably so. He was wearing opaque aviator glasses, so she couldn't see his eyes, but if they were as belligerent as his expression and stance, she was better off not seeing them.<br><br>"I don't know what you're talking about."<br><br>"The letters, lady, the letters." He strained the words through a set of strong white teeth.<br><br>"What letters?"<br><br>"Don't play dumb."<br><br>"Are you sure you've got the right house?"<br><br>He took another step forward. "I've got the right house," he said in a voice that was little more than a snarl.<br><br>"Obviously you don't." She didn't like being put on the defensive, especially by someone she'd never met over something of which she was totally ignorant. "You're either crazy or drunk, but in any case, you're wrong. I'm not the person you're looking for and I demand that you leave my property. Now."<br><br>"You were expecting me. I could tell by the way you spoke to me."<br><br>"I thought you were the man from the advertising agency."<br><br>"Well, I'm not."<br><br>"Thank God." She would hate having to do business with someone this irrational and ill-tempered.<br><br>"You know damn well who I am," he said, peeling off the sunglasses.<br><br>Marnie sucked in a quick, sharp breath and fell back a step because she did indeed know who he was. She raised a hand to her chest in an attempt at keeping her jumping heart in place. "Law," she gasped.<br><br>"That's right. Law Kincaid. Just like you wrote it on the envelopes."<br><br>She was shocked to see him after all these years, standing only inches in front of her. This time he wasn't merely a familiar image in the newspaper or on her television screen. He was flesh and blood. The years had been kind to that flesh, improving his looks, not eroding them.<br><br>She wanted to stand and stare, but he was staring at her with unmitigated contempt and no recognition at all. "Let's go inside, Mr. Kincaid," she suggested softly.<br><br>Several of her neighbors, who had been taking advantage of the sunny weekend weather to do yard chores, had stopped moving, edging, and watering to gawk at the car and Miss Hibbs's visitor.<br>It wasn't out of the ordinary for a man to come to her house. Many of her clients were men and most of them consulted with her there. Generally they were stodgy executives in dark business suits. Few had deep tans, looked like movie stars, and drove such ostentatious cars.<br><br>This area of Houston wasn't glitzy like some of the newer neighborhoods. Most of the residents were middle-aged and drove sensible sedans. A Porsche on the block was a curious thing indeed. And to her neighbors' recollections, Marnie Hibbs had never engaged in a shouting match with anyone.<br><br>She turned on the squeaky rubber soles of her sneakers and led Law Kincaid up the sidewalk and through the front door of her house. Air-conditioning was a welcome respite from the humidity outside, but since she was damp with perspiration, the colder air chilled her. Or maybe it was her distinct awareness of the man behind her that was giving her goose bumps.<br><br>"This way."<br><br>She led him down a spacious hallway, the kind that could be found only in houses built before World War II, and toward the glassed-in back porch, which served as her studio. There she felt more at home, more at ease, and better able to deal with the astonishing reality that Law Kincaid had unexpectedly walked into her life again.<br><br>When she turned to face him, his arctic-blue eyes were darting around the studio. They connected with hers like magnets.<br><br>"Well?" he said tersely, placing his hands on his hips. He was obviously awaiting a full explanation for something Marnie was in the dark about herself.<br><br>"I don't know anything about any letters, Mr. Kincaid."<br><br>"They were mailed from this address."<br><br>"Then there's been a mistake at the post office."<br><br>"Unlikely. Not five times over the course of several weeks. Look, Mrs. uh . . . what was it again?"<br><br>"Hibbs. Miss Hibbs."<br><br>He gave her a swift, inquisitive once-over. "Miss Hibbs, I've been a bachelor for thirty-nine years. <br><br>"It's been a while since puberty. I don't remember every woman I've gone to bed with."<br><br>Her heart did another little dance number, and she took a quick, insufficient breath. "I've never been to bed with you."<br><br>He threw one hip slightly off-center and cocked his head arrogantly. "Then how is it that you claim to have mothered a son by me? A son I'd never even heard of until I got your first letter several weeks ago."<br><br>Marnie stared at him with speechless dismay. She could feel the color draining from her face. It felt like the world had been yanked from beneath her feet.<br><br>"I've never had a child. And I repeat, I never sent you a letter." She gestured at a chair. "Why don't you sit down?" She didn't offer him a seat out of courtesy or any concern for his comfort. She was afraid that if she didn't sit, and soon, her knees would buckle beneath her.<br><br>He thought about it for a moment, gnawing irritably on the corner of his lower lip before he moved to a rattan chair. He sat down on the very edge of the cushion, as though wanting to be ready to spring off it if the need arose.<br><br>Self-conscious of her muddy sneakers, ragged cutoffs, and ancient T-shirt, Marnie sat in the matching chair facing his. She sat straight, keeping her dirty knees together and clasping her hands nervously on the tops of her thighs.<br><br>She felt unclothed and vulnerable as his incisive eyes moved over her, taking in her face, her uncombed hair, her yard work attire, and her grubby knees.<br><br>"You recognized me." He shot the sentence at her like a missile.<br><br>"Anybody who watches TV or reads a newspaper would recognize you. You're the most popular astronaut since John Glenn."<br><br>"And therefore I'm a visible target for every nutcase who comes down the pike."<br><br>"I am not a nutcase!"<br><br>"Then why the hell have you been sending me those letters? That's not even an original idea, you know. I get several dozen a day."<br><br>"Congratulations."<br><br>"They're not all fan letters. Some are hate mail from the religious crazies who believe we're going where God never intended man to go. Some credit God with the Challenger accident--His punishment for our tampering with heaven or nonsense to that effect. I've had proposals of marriage and of other assorted liaisons of a prurient and/or perverted nature," he said dryly.<br><br>"How nice for you."<br><br>Ignoring her snide remark, he continued. "But your letters had a stroke of originality. You were the first one to claim that I was the father of your child."<br><br>"Don't you listen? I told you I've never had a child. How could you possibly be the father?"<br><br>"My point exactly, Miss Hibbs!" he shouted.<br><br>Marnie stood. So did he. He tracked her when she moved to her drafting table and needle...</p><h2>Options: Essential Concepts and Trading Strategies</h2><p>Options, when used strategically can help investors control investment risk, capitalize on market opportunities, or enhance investment income.

He resented like hell that he couldn't have her thrown into Newgate Prison where she belonged.<br><br>She had costumed herself like a French queen from the previous century, but she appeared uncomfortable with the illusion. She held herself stiffly whenever she moved, as if she expected the high white wig to topple off or the padded, hooped gown to tip her over. The confidence of her voice contrasted with her physical awkwardness. Poses of professional self-possession contrasted with short strolls of vulnerability.<br><br>He was not fooled by her calculated charm. With her wide eyes and full lips and intimations of frailty, she affected the most dangerous type of innocence. It was the kind that prompted a man to want to lay down his life to protect it, but which provoked another, darker part to imagine stripping off her clothes and destroying it.<br><br>She moved in his direction, raising her head for the high notes of a vocal display. Her gaze met his. A flicker of curiosity passed, as if she perceived that he would not be here if duty did not demand it.<br><br>He knew that nothing in his appearance told her that. This gaming establishment had added staged shows to cater to men of his class. They took breaks from their gambling to eat in this salon and enjoy a concert of opera, or, later, entertainment of a much baser sort.<br><br>She looked longer than she ought, boldly meeting his inspection with one of her own. He suppressed the alarming combination of protective and erotic inclinations that those wide eyes summoned, by concentrating on all of the trouble that she had caused him the last two weeks.<br><br>Morton slid into the other chair at his table. Morton did look out of place with his bearish form and unfashionable beard.<br><br>"The girl is here," he said. "In a room in back. Miss Ormond brings her every night, to wait there while she sings. I spoke with the man at the door and he saw them come in together tonight."<br><br>Vergil rose. "Miss Ormond sings an art song after this aria. Let us do it now. We will have the girl out before she finishes." The unsuspecting Miss Ormond warbled on. "If she is smart, she will run for the coast when she learns her plans were foiled. As for the girl, we will bring her to the country to recover, and no one will be the wiser."<br><br>He was assuming, of course, that Miss Jane Ormond had not already sold the girl to the highest bidder. He narrowed his attention on the deceptively ingenuous face beneath the towering white wig. There was something intelligent in those eyes. No, she wouldn't have risked all of this for so small a prize as a virgin's price. Perhaps she had planned to ask for a ransom, but most likely her intentions were to sell the girl in marriage. Since she had served as the girl's maid and they had traveled from America together, she undoubtedly knew about the inheritance.<br><br>This all might have been avoided if Dante had been more alert. His own fault that, sending his brother to meet their ship, but whoever expected this chit of a maid to dare such a thing.<br><br>The seedy back corridor contrasted with the opulence of the dining salon. Morton gestured to a door tucked beneath a stairway. Vergil turned the handle.<br><br>He had visited singers' preparation rooms before and they were normally disasters of confusion. This tiny space had been carefully organized. A brace of candles sat on a small table that also held a mirror and containers of paint. Costumes and day clothes hung from a row of hooks on the wall. A chair crowded the shadows to the right of the table, and a young woman sat mending there with her needle and cloth held close to the flames.<br><br>"Miss Bianca Kenwood?"<br><br>She looked up in surprise and he immediately began calculating how much he would have to increase the bribe to Dante. She could well be a sweet girl, but Dante judged females by appearance, not character, and hers was not impressive. The brown wisps of hair escaping her cap looked more frizzy than curly. Her nose turned up at the end, which might have been charming if the nose had been less broad.<br><br>"Miss Kenwood, I am Laclere."<br><br>"Oh!"<br><br>"This is Morton, my valet. I have a coach behind the building and we will take you there at once. Your ordeal is over, and I assure you that no one will ever know about this unfortunate interlude."<br><br>"Oh! Oh, my . . ."<br><br>"If you will come at once, please. I will deal with Miss Ormond later. Right now it is best if we remove you from here."<br><br>"Oh, I don't think . . . that is . . ." She cowered back, making gestures of resistance and confusion. He bent toward her and smiled reassuringly. He noticed that her gown was of the most common sort, a gray simple broadcloth. Evidently she had no sense for fashion, either.<br><br>"Come, my dear. It would be best if we left before--"<br><br>"Who are you?" The voice asking the indignant question was feminine, melodious, and young.<br><br>Vergil pivoted to see Marie Antoinette standing in the doorway, hands akimbo on her little waist, the broad-hipped gown flaring out to span the threshold. "Well? Who are you, sir, and what are you doing here?"<br><br>Miss Kenwood leapt up and darted over to Miss Ormond, who embraced her protectively. So that was how it was. Of course she had befriended the girl. It wouldn't have worked otherwise.<br><br>"Your concert is finished?" he asked.<br><br>"The lieder are brief works. Now, if you would leave please. My sister and I--"<br><br>"Miss Ormond, this young woman is not your sister. She is no relation to you whatsoever. You may have convinced her to come with you, but your behavior has been nothing less than abduction and will be seen as such by the Justice of the Peace."<br><br>Miss Ormond eased the girl away, then pressed her gown so that she could squish into the room. The breadth of the ridiculous skirt forced Morton against the wall.<br><br>She crossed her arms over her chest. The gesture brought Vergil's attention to the upper swells of firm breasts crushed under the top of her stiff bodice.<br><br>"Which one are you?"<br><br>"Vergilius Duclairc, the Viscount Laclere. Miss Kenwood is my ward, but then you know that."<br><br>Her gaze drifted down, then up. "I know nothing of the sort."<br><br>Her poise, despite being caught at this crime, annoyed him to no end. "Do not think to play a game of wits with me, young woman. Your betrayal of the trust that made you her companion on the crossing is abominable. The danger and potential scandal to which you have subjected her these last weeks is inexcusable. I will not stand for any interference now. If you act quickly, you can be on your way back to America before daybreak, but I only make this concession for Miss Kenwood's sake."<br><br>She didn't even blink. She stepped forward until her flounces brushed his leg, and looked up in a considering, curious way. "Ah. You are one of those."<br><br>He stared her down. If she were a man, a good thrashing would be in order.<br><br>She glanced at the distraught girl, cowering against the doorframe. "It appears that it is over, doesn't it? Too bad, I really thought that I might pull it off." She gestured, and Miss Kenwood joined her while she began removing the garments from their hooks and folding them.<br><br>He stepped between them, took a gown from his ward's hands, and cast it aside. "We will leave now. If Miss Kenwood has belongings here or at your lodgings, I will send for them."<br><br>Miss Ormond smiled in a damned insolent manner. "Oh, you are most definitely one of those. Very sure of yourself. A man who sets his course and always knows it is the right one. I was warned that this country has a lot of men like you, men who are positive that they never make mistakes."<br><br>He felt his face flush at this soiled dove's presumption. Enough. He took a gray broadcloth arm in his hand.<br><br>Miss Ormond shifted and blocked his retreat with the eternal span of her gown. Her warm, soft hand covered his and gently pried his fingers loose. The gray broadcloth slipped away.<br><br>Blue eyes looked up with mocking delight. "Well, this time you have made a mistake, Vergilius Duclairc, Viscount Laclere. In fact, you have got it all backward. She is not Bianca Kenwood. I am."<br><br>He had a moment of incomprehension before the meaning of her words struck. Intimations of trouble flurried through his mind, a light snow of foreboding that suggested fairly simple arrangements had just become dangerously complicated. He glanced to the timid gray wren kneading her hands together, and then at the self-confident, painted bird of paradise, and wondered how Dante would react to this shocking development.<br><br>Thwap. Thwap, thwap.<br><br>The riding whip slapped against the high boot of the Viscount Laclere while he paced in front of the fireplace.<br><br>Bianca embraced Jane on the chaise longue, patting her shoulder. Across the drawing room, the Countess of Glasbury, the viscount's sister, blinked with drowsy dismay in her Oriental-style green dressing gown.<br><br>Bianca thought it had been very rude of Vergil Duclairc to rouse the countess from her sleep when he dragged Jane and Bianca here to the countess's town home. If he would stop brooding and pacing she could clear this up in a snap and they could be gone.<br><br>Thwap. Thwap.<br><br>"You don't plan to use that do you?" Bianca asked. Her voice cracked the tense silence that had ensued with the end of his explanation to the countess about where he had found his missing ward after two weeks of searching.<br><br>He pivoted in midpace and glared at her. He was a tall, lean, well-framed man in his middle twenties, with startling blue eyes and wavy dark hair dishevelled in the current fashion. Attractive, actually. Perhaps even handsome when he wasn't scowling, but then she wouldn't know.<br><br>"The whip," she said. "You don't plan to use it? I should tell you that I am twenty years old and Jane is twenty-two, which makes us far past the age for such things. Although my aunt has a maid who was courted by an Englishman who told her that there are quite a few men who whip grown women here in England, which I found very peculiar, and others, it turns out, who actually want women to whip them, which I don't think makes any sense at all."<br><br>The countess gasped. She appeared fully awake suddenly.<br><br>Vergil turned to his sister with strained forbearance. He threw out his arm toward the chaise longue in a gesture that said, "See?"<br><br>"Really, Miss Kenwood," the countess said with a wavering smile. "Of course my brother has no intention of . . . of . . ."<br><br>Vergil's lids lowered as if there were no "of course" to it. He clasped his hands behind his back and studied her severely. "My brother came to meet your ship in Liverpool. How did you miss him?"<br><br>Bianca considered whether to use the elaborate history of misadventures that she had concocted in the event things ever went this wrong. It suddenly struck her as very thin.<br><br>She examined the blue eyes piercing her. Aunt Edith had said that the English aristocrats were an overbred, indolent people, and a bit stupid, and Bianca had counted on that being accurate. Unfortunately, this one appeared the exception, at least with regards to the last descriptive. He didn't seem likely to be bought off with confused tales of hapless innocence.<br><br>"There was a sailor on board who helped us remove our trunks and find a hired coach before anyone came and called for us."<br><br>"You befriended a sailor?" The countess glanced askance at her brother, who briefly shut his eyes.<br><br>"Miss Kenwood, perhaps there has been a misunderstanding. Your grandfather's solicitor contacted a Baltimore attorney, a Mr. Williams, to handle this matter. He did come to speak with you, did he not? I was not misinformed, was I?"<br><br>"He most certainly came. He is a very nice man. In fact, he secured our passage on the ship."<br><br>"As he wrote to me that he would. Did he explain to you that a member of our family would meet you in Liverpool?"<br><br>"He explained it very clearly. My aunt would never have permitted me to come if she were not reassured that I would be met."<br><br>"So you admit that you disembarked on your own without waiting for an escort, that it was no accident that my brother missed you?"<br><br>"It was no accident. It was very deliberate."<br><br>For some reason her frankness left him speechless. He looked at her as if she were incomprehensible.<br><br>"I think it would be best if you sat, Vergil, so you do not fluster her by hovering like that," the countess said. "Then maybe we could discuss this calmly. I'm sure that Miss Kenwood has an explanation for everything."<br><br>Vergil sat on a small bench, but he still managed to hover in her direction all the same. "Do you have an explanation?"<br><br>"Of course." Jane had fallen asleep on her shoulder and the dead weight distracted her. Their embrace had unsettled the wig and she could feel it tilting askew. These old gowns were not designed for sitting, and the pads formed a platform all around her. The stays under her costume dug into her waist and side.<br><br>She felt a little ridiculous and very uncomfortable, and annoyed that this high-and-mighty viscount had not given her time to change or wash before hauling her into his coach.<br><br>"The explanation, Miss Kenwood. I should like to hear it."<br><br>"Actually, Mr. Duclairc, I really do not think that you would."<br><br>His eyes narrowed. "Let us try, anyway."<br><br>She tucked one leg up under her rump, to prop herself up more. The countess's lashes fluttered. The viscount cocked an eyebrow censoriously. Realizing that her dangling leg was uncovered to midcalf, Bianca smiled apologetically and pushed the skirt hem down.<br><br>"Mr. Duclairc, I was aware of the plans arranged for my visit here. I simply decided to make a few alterations. If Mr. Williams communicated with you about me, you may know that I lived with my great-aunt Edith more as her companion than her ward. I traveled extensively when my mother was alive, and learned to take care of myself. I am regarded as very mature for my years."<br><br>"He only wrote that your aunt is a bulwark of Baltimore society and that you are a well-bred young woman." His tone implied that Mr. Williams had some explaining to do.<br><br>"I know that my grandfather named you as my guardian in his will. It was a charming and quaint gesture. He probably wanted to cover the eventuality that I actually needed a guardian, which I obviously do not. Besides, I am American, so I do not see how an English will can establish that kind of authority over me."</p><h2>Gone Bamboo [Paperback] Bourdain, Anthony</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p></p><h2>The Shaker Chair</h2><p>For well over a century, the world has noted the distinctive chairs made by Shaker communities throughout the eastern United States. A writer for House Beautiful suggested at the beginning of the twentieth century that &#34;If you own a Shaker chair, preserve it with great care, for it will soon be considered an antique, and a rare one at that.&#34; In this definitive book, that statement is verified as the authors examine in depth the styles and production techniques of chairs made at ten Shaker communities during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Historical and contemporary photographs, extensive journal and account book references, diaries, postcards, catalog advertisements, and detailed line drawings are all used to document the chairs&#39; history. Readers will find valuable information on identification of chair types and origins as well as an analysis of design and construction. An essential resource for collectors, historians, designers, and devotees of antique furniture.</p><p>Charles R. Muller is former editor of Antique Review. He previously wrote The Shaker Way as well as numerous articles on antiques and the Shakers. He lives in Ohio.

As Christians, when we do something in service&#x2014;engaging the needs of our sister and brothers in the name of Jesus Christ&#x2014;we minister for the reign of God. The Romero House volunteers, whose narratives undergird this volume, actively construct a theology of ministry while undergoing a powerful sense of personal transformation. In <i>Ministry That Transforms</i>, Kathleen McAlpin:</p><ul><li>Showcases the Romero House group and her program of Integration for Ministry that provides adult education and ministry formation</li><li>Lays out a transformative Contemplative Theological Reflection Process leading to conversion, contemplation, and holiness through practice and dialogue</li><li>Enlists Scripture, social justice concerns, and a cast of critical thinkers in the theology of ministry</li></ul><p>&nbsp;<br> Anyone involved in ministry&#x2014;whether in formation programs, in parishes, or in social justice activities&#x2014;will welcome this creative, process-oriented framework for ministerial theology and faith development, a framework that is firmly grounded in the minister&#x2019;s grassroots experience.</p></p><p>Kathleen McAlpin, RSM, DMin, teaches spiritual direction at Regis College in Toronto and Creighton University. She directs the Integration for Ministry Program at Regis College, where she also facilitates a contemplative method of theological reflection for both integration and formation for ministry.&#34;For those who have wondered about the connection between spirituality and theological reflection, Kathleen McAlpin has provided a clear, compelling, and practical answer. Her integration of spirituality into the theological reflection process is a welcome addition to the several models of reflection-on-ministry currently available. In her approach contemplation guides theological reflection toward the ongoing conversion of the minister and confirms theological reflection as a transformative process not only for the minister but for the ministry performed. The extensive use of personal experiences from those she has worked with, especially members of Romero House in Toronto, gives concreteness and appeal to the model she has developed.&#34;</p><h2>Baby Love: A Tradition of Calm Parenting</h2><p>Presents advice for caring for a newborn covering topics such as sleeping, eating, bathing, diapering, and outings</p><p>s to baby care, the very best advice comes not from the "experts," but from the real-life experience of generations of women.

Recipes for such date as far back as the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. This version is more akin to the butterscotch and butter rum flavors that are common in puddings and candies. The distinguishing characteristic from those flavors is that this contains a significant grain component, which in my opinion is what earns it the &#x201c;beer&#x201d; moniker. I prefer a lighter crystal malt for this, such as a 20L. If a darker malt is used, it&#x2019;s better to use less of it.</p> <p><b></b></p><p></p> <p><b></b></p><b>Directions:</b><p></p> <p>Using a grain mill, crack the caramel malt. In a saucepan, bring the water to a boil and then remove from the heat. For the syrup and seltzer method, use 1 cup (235 ml) water; otherwise, use as much water as is practical to strain. Add the crushed grain and cinnamon and let steep for 20 minutes. Strain out the grain and return the water to the saucepan. (A coffee filter may be required for a final straining to remove any remaining cinnamon. ) Add the sugar (or sugars) and heat over medium-high heat until the sugar has dissolved. For the syrup and seltzer method chill the syrup, add the extracts, and add to carbonated water (syrup for 1 gallon [3.8 L] finished soda; use 2 to 3 tablespoons [28 to 45 ml] per 8 ounces [235 ml] carbonated water, or to taste). For straight carbonation or fermentation, add the rest of the water and the extracts to the syrup. For straight carbonation, chill the mixture before adding it to the keg or carbonator of your choice. For fermentation, hydrate the yeast in � cup (60 ml) or less of warm water. Add the hydrated yeast to the mixture after it has cooled to 10 to 15�F (5.5 to 8�C) above room temperature. Stir in the yeast nutrient. Mix well and then bottle.

If ever there was an athletic exploit specifically not for the faint of heart and feeble of limb, this is it. So you might ask, what is Tim Moore doing cycling it?<br><br>An extremely good question. Ignoring the pleading dictates of reason and common sense, Moore determined to tackle the Tour de France, all 2,256 miles of it, in the weeks before the professionals entered the stage. This decision was one he would regret for nearly its entire length. But readers-those who now know Moore's name deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Bill Bryson and Calvin Trillin-will feel otherwise. They are in for a side-splitting treat. <br><br><i>French Revolutions</i> gives us a hilariously unforgettable account of Moore's attempt to conquer the Tour de France. "Conquer" may not be quite the right word. He cheats when he can, pops the occasional hayfever pill for an ephedrine rush (a fine old Tour tradition), sips cheap wine from his water bottle, and occasionally weeps on the phone to his wife. But along the way he gives readers an account of the race's colorful history and greatest heroes: Eddy Merckx, Greg Lemond, Lance Armstrong, and even Firmin Lambot, aka the "Lucky Belgian," who won the race at the age of 36. Fans of the Tour de France will learn why the yellow jersey is yellow, and how cyclists learned to save precious seconds (a race that lasts for three weeks is all about split seconds) by relieving themselves en route. And if that isn't enough, his account of a rural France tarting itself up for its moment in the spotlight leaves popular quaint descriptions of small towns in Provence in the proverbial dust. If you either love or hate the French, or both, this is the book for you.<br><br><i>French Revolutions</i> is Tim Moore's funniest book to date. It is also one of the funniest sports books ever written.<br></p><p>The ultimate amateur attempts to cycle the Tour de France route. <p>"Put me back on my bike." As last words go, these are unlikely to pass Tim Moore's lips. The author attempts to cycle all 3,630 km of the 2000 Tour de France route just before the professionals do. His is an epic depiction of an inadequate man's attempt to achieve the unachievable, a tale of calorific excess, ludicrous clothing and intimate discomfort.</p>Tim Moore is the author of <i>Frost on My Moustache</i> and <i>The Grand Tour</i>, both available from St. Martin's Griffin. He lives with his family in London.<br></p><h2>Devil Does Exist, The: VOL 02</h2><p>When her mother becomes engaged to the high school principal, Kayano&#39;s life gets even more complicated since the principal&#39;s son, Takeru, constantly bullies her.</p><p></p><h2>Isak Dinesen&#39;s Africa</h2><p>LIKE NEW FIRST EDITION HARDCOVER WITH DUST JACKET COLLECTIBLE.</p><p>In her memoir, Out of Africa, and in short stories, Danish-born writer Dinesen evoked a timeless Africa distilled from her 18 years on a Kenya coffee plantation. This lovely-looking but ultimately shallow picture book, a tie-in with the film based on Out of Africa, splices excerpts from Dinesen's autobiographical writings, stories and letters with color photographs of Africa's land, people and wildlife. For readers familiar with her works, the album is pleasant enough, though readers expecting visual signs of today's real, changing, troubled Africa will be disappointed. In an almost apologetic introduction, Judith Thurman, Dinesen's biographer, notes that the writer was not a conservationist, enjoyed big game hunting and had paternalistic, feudal relationships with Africans. Nevertheless, Dinesen upheld the dignity and value of African culture, and her rhythmic prose captured the complex poetry of Africa's landscape. These positive qualities are rendered in photos taken by Peter Beard, Galen Rowell, Frank Connor and others.

Even the simplest dish becomes something special when herbs are included. And herbs don&#39;t add fat or calories! Just flavor, Plus, many of them have health-giving benefits, as well. When I first moved back to the Midwest from the East Coast two decades ago, only one place near where I lived sold herbs. Now every garden center and discount department store carries at least the basic culinary herbs, and many areas have at least one place that specializes in a wide range of herbs. There are wonderful mail-order companies that offer more herbs than you can imagine. This means that there is a wealth of opportunity to use and experiment with herbs from around the world. Although I grow all kinds of plants, there is something particularly endearing about herbs. High on the list of reasons is that almost all of them are incredibly easy to grow, both in the garden and in containers. And it&#39;s possible to have most of my favorite herbs in a relatively small space. I also like the historical connection that herbs provide, plus the folklore that surrounds them. Here is a quality to herbs, more than with any other plants, that is inherently soothing. Just walking among them in the garden calms me. And oh, those wonderful fragrances. But because I am one of those people who lives to eat, it is what herbs bring to the table that is most important. Wether in a cold, refeshing drink in summer or a warming tea in winter, in a last-minute stir-fry or slow-simmerng stew, added fresh to a salad or preserved in venegar or a jar of jelly, herbs enrich my life with their flavor.</p><p></p><h2>The Experiments of Dr. Vermin</h2><p>On a dark and scary Halloween night, Sheldon the short-order pig is out looking for work when his car breaks down. Gathering up his courage, he approaches an ominous-looking mansion and enters the twisted world of Dr. Edmund Vermin! Will poor Sheldon escape or be forever trapped in Dr. Vermin&#x2019;s laboratory? Things aren&#x2019;t what they seem in Tim Egan&#x2019;s latest zany tale of ravishing wolves, giant pigs and . . . horseradish!</p><p>Tim Egan is the author and illustrator of several offbeat and humorous tales for children. He is consistently recognized for his individuality and delightful illustrations. Born in New Jersey, Tim moved to California to attend the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California.

Then a loud clap and a distant howling in the dark woods terrify him, as he has a distinct fear of both thunder and wolves. And so begins the rollicking romp through the mansion of the evil Dr. Vermin, who captures Sheldon, turning him into a pig monster four times his original size. When the mad scientist realizes that he doesn't have control of his victim's mind, he kicks him out, and Sheldon runs next door for help, only to find two kindly humans who, he learns, are really wolves on whom Dr. Vermin has experimented. The pig admirably faces all of his fears, saving the day (or night, in this case) and securing a job in the process-cooking for the wolf couple. Egan's not-at-all-frightening artwork is full of amusing details, from the expressions of the evil doctor and terrified pig to the wolves in human form. Young children will enjoy the muted artwork as much as they will appreciate this super silly, slightly scary story.<br><i>Lisa Gangemi Kropp, Middle Country Public Library, Centereach, NY</i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Worth the Trouble (St. James, 2)</h2><p><p>Cover girl Cat St. James&#x2019;s picture-perfect life is anything but flawless.

When her daughter Melissa gives her a diary for Christmas, at first Joan is horrified who the hell does Melissa think she is? That fat pig, Bridget Jones? But as Joan, being both beautiful and introspective, begins to record her day-to-day musings, she realizes she has a lot to say.<br> <br> <i>About everything. And everyone, God help them. </i><br> <br> The result? A no-holds-barred, delightfully vicious and always hilarious look at the everyday life of the ultimate diva. Follow Joan on a family vacation in Mexico and on trips between New York and Los Angeles where she mingles with the stars, never missing a beat as she delivers blistering critiques on current events, and excoriating insights about life, pop culture, and celebrities (from A to D list), all in her relentlessly funny signature style.<br> <br> This is the <i>Diary of a Mad Diva</i>. For the first time in a century, a diary by someone that&#x2019;s actually worth reading.</p><p>Comedienne, Emmy Award&#x2013;winning TV host, Tony-nominated actress, Grammy-winner (for her audiobook of <i>Diary of a Mad Diva</i>) and CEO, <b>Joan Rivers </b>was an icon of American culture, a bestselling author, <i>Celebrity Apprentice</i> winner, writer, producer, director, and savvy businesswoman who overcame great odds to reinvent herself time and time again. She hosted E! Network&#x2019;s popular series <i>Fashion Police</i>, and starred with her daughter, Melissa, in their own weekly reality show, <i>Joan and Melissa:</i> <i>Joan Knows Best?</i> on WEtv Network. Her critically acclaimed documentary, <i>Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work </i>premiered in theaters nationwide and is available on DVD. Amongst all of her success, Joan&#x2019;s most joyous triumph was being a mother and grandmother.<p></p><p>This diary was written to the best of Joan Rivers&#x2019;s memory. As such, some of the events may not be 100 percent&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or even 5 percent factually correct. Miss Rivers is, after all, 235 years old, and frequently mistakes her daughter, Melissa, for the actor Laurence Fishburne.</p><p>Miss Rivers wrote this diary as a comedic tome, not unlike <i>Saving Private Ryan</i> or <i>The Bell Jar</i>. While Miss Rivers doesn&#x2019;t really like skinny models and actresses, she doesn&#x2019;t actually believe that they&#x2019;re all bulimics and they all carry buckets instead of purses. Similarly, she doesn&#x2019;t really think that all Germans are anti-Semitic Nazi sympathizers, that all Mexican Americans tunneled in across the border, that all celebrities are drug addicts, shoplifters or closet cases, or that Noah built his ark with non-union labor.</p><p>Miss Rivers does, however, believe that anyone who takes anything in this book seriously is an idiot. And she says if anyone has a problem with that they can feel free to call her lawyer, Clarence Darrow.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Fuck Lamaze. You try downing a bottle of Barbies with a dry throat.</p><p></p><p></p><p>JANUARY 1</p><p>Dear Diary:</p><p>This diary is my Christmas gift from Melissa and Cooper and I&#x2019;m more disappointed than I was on my wedding night when I found out that Edgar was half Chinese&#x2014;and not the good half. And this diary&#x2019;s not even from a good store. I was hoping for at least a Car-tier watch. I wouldn&#x2019;t even have minded if it was spelled with a <i>K</i>. I know, it&#x2019;s Christmas season and we&#x2019;re Jewish and we shouldn&#x2019;t care about gifts, but if indeed we did kill Christ&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m not saying we did; for all we know he could have slipped and fallen onto that cross (maybe he was clumsy; maybe he drank)&#x2014;then something&#x2019;s got to ease the guilt. And the more expensive that something is, the less guilty I feel.</p><p>Anyhow, this is a new book for a new year and I&#x2019;m feeling great. To celebrate, I got matching vagina piercings with my two best girlfriends, Margie Stern and Brucey Jenner.</p><p>I&#x2019;m writing this in Mexico. On the spur of the moment, Melissa, Cooper and I decided to fly down here, and we were right: It&#x2019;s a perfect way to ring in the New Year&#x2014;great resort, private beach and plenty of servants who&#x2019;ll do anything for a thirty-cent tip. This place is kind of like Downton Abbey with sombreros. Last night I got an eight-hour pedicure from Maria while resting my feet on her &#x201c;brother,&#x201d; Jose, who was crouched over like a footstool. I let him switch positions every two hours so he wouldn&#x2019;t cramp and, more importantly, so Maria wouldn&#x2019;t slip and accidentally paint my ankles dusty coral. Unfortunately I can&#x2019;t take credit for the position-switching thing; I got the idea by watching <i>Amistad</i> on cable last week. I think if the ship&#x2019;s captain had let the slaves switch sides every couple of days not only would they have rowed faster but they would have had the strength to make faces at Anthony Hopkins.</p><p>This morning when I woke up and looked out my window, there was Conchita, out in the field threshing wheat so that her &#x201c;brother,&#x201d; Juan, would be able to make me toast for my morning breakfast. I appreciate all of my south-of-the-border neighbors&#x2019; semi-hard work and hope they&#x2019;ve stolen enough loose change and shiny trinkets from my bureau so that when they get caught trying to tunnel into America next month, they&#x2019;ll have money to pay a mediocre deportation lawyer.</p><p>JANUARY 2</p><p>Dear Diary:</p><p>I haven&#x2019;t kept a diary in years. The last time I kept one I had just come back from a girls-only weekend with Eleanor Roosevelt and her best friend, Gayle. We all giggled that girls are better than guys, and then we douched with Gatorade and wrist-wrestled till we fell asleep.</p><p>I wasn&#x2019;t planning on keeping a journal this time, but when I told my friend Bambi I was going to Mexico for the new year, she said, &#x201c;Oh, you ought to keep a diary, like whatshername did&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. oh, like Anne Frank did.&#x201d; Like Anne Frank did???? Did you read Anne Frank&#x2019;s diary??? What a bitch Bambi has turned out to be, to compare me to Anne Frank! I&#x2019;ve written six books, and Anne? She didn&#x2019;t even complete her one. She&#x2019;s no writer. Did you ever read her book? She has no ending! &#x201c;Uh-oh! The Nazis are coming up the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;m trying to forgive Bambi; it&#x2019;s been such a long friendship. I knew her way back when she was still Bernice, before the electrolysis, the implants, the Restylane and the glass eye that almost works. I forgave her bitterness. She turned the day her husband, Ernie, a prominent Long Island orthodontist, left her for a fifty-three-year-old Little League coach/Boy Scout leader with a severe overbite. Until this we were friends, but to compare me to Anne Frank? Who the fuck does she think she is? I&#x2019;m nothing like Anne Frank. She lived in a walk-up; I live in a penthouse. And unlike Anne Frank, I <i>do</i> things: I go out. I shop. I go to the theater. I get <i>professional </i>haircuts. I&#x2019;m way up there and I&#x2019;m a gal on the go; Anne Frank was fifteen and that lazy bitch played the shut-in card for almost three years. No, Bambi, if I keep a diary it won&#x2019;t be like Anne Frank&#x2019;s; just for openers, it&#x2019;ll be in English.</p><p>JANUARY 3</p><p>Dear Diary:</p><p>Trouble started today with AT&amp;T. I hate AT&amp;T. It obviously stands for Always Terrible Transmission. I tried to call the States and couldn&#x2019;t, so I called AT&amp;T about my international phone service, which sucks more than Monica Lewinsky under a White House desk, and I got a recording that told me &#x201c;a disabled war veteran will answer your call.&#x201d; Great. I have to complain about my long-distance bill to Private Jimmy, who lost his face, ass and limbs in Tora Bora. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry you&#x2019;re a torso on a dolly, Private First Class Jimmy, but does that mean for the rest of my life I have to pay an extra $6 for data roaming?&#x201d;</p><p>What do you say when they hit you with &#x201c;a disabled vet will try to give you a hand&#x201d;? Do you chance it and answer, &#x201c;Does he have one?&#x201d; I hate being put in awkward positions, like the utter disappointment I felt after I did a benefit performance for thalidomide adults and no one applauded. To this day I&#x2019;m not sure whether the silence was because they couldn&#x2019;t clap or because they didn&#x2019;t like me.</p><p>Anyhow, I did what any American would do: sent a check to Wounded Warriors, hung up on the motherfucker, and switched to Verizon.</p><p>JANUARY 4</p><p>Dear Diary:</p><p>Something about Anne Frank&#x2019;s story kept bothering me and I finally figured out what. It&#x2019;s not that she wasn&#x2019;t pretty; a lot of girls aren&#x2019;t pretty and they still do okay, right, Avril Lavigne? But Anne just didn&#x2019;t try. How would it have hurt the woman who slipped her food when the Nazis weren&#x2019;t looking to have included a lipstick, an eye shadow and, God knows, a concealer? The girl had nothing but time on her hands. Would it have killed Anne to take a couple of minutes out of her &#x201c;busy&#x201d; day and throw on a little blush? And there&#x2019;s something else I just can&#x2019;t make sense out of. With all of that &#x201c;me time&#x201d; available, why didn&#x2019;t Anne&#x2019;s mother redecorate? You can do a lot with blackout curtains if you&#x2019;re willing to strain your brain a little and think outside the box. Hopefully the answer will come to me before Passover. I&#x2019;d hate to interrupt the Seder by adding a fifth question: &#x201c;Were there no throw pillows in all of Amsterdam?&#x201d;</p><p>JANUARY 5</p><p>Dear Diary:</p><p>We&#x2019;ve been down here almost a week and I&#x2019;m beginning to realize the Mexicans are not a swell-looking people. Not all Mexicans, just the Mayan-influenced staff working here at the resort. They have no necks. Perhaps it&#x2019;s because they spent all those years carrying heavy stones on their heads to build their gloomy and useless temples. Their heads look like pumpkins sitting on washing machines. I don&#x2019;t say this in a judgmental, pejorative way; I say it in a capitalistic way, because frankly, I have a jewelry line, and if they have no necks that means they can&#x2019;t buy necklaces and that means that my beloved Cooper might have to go to some cheap community college, or worse, join the Peace Corps and work for free&#x2014;for free!&#x2014;helping other people who have no necks.</p><p>JANUARY 6</p><p>Dear Diary:</p><p>Watching the news. Today was the anniversary of two of the biggest events in American history: Nancy Kerrigan getting clubbed in the knee in 1994, and Congress giving the 2000 election to George W. Bush. My world was changed on that fateful day, and since then I&#x2019;ve never been able to watch figure skating the same way. Up until then I always thought of figure skating as something gay men who were tone-deaf and couldn&#x2019;t sing in piano bars did to pass their time, but it turns out I was wrong. Figure skating is something needy women with thin lips and big thighs do to pass their time. Innocence lost.</p><p>JANUARY 7</p><p>Dear Diary:</p><p>Today was our travel day back to New York. The airport was packed and I felt a little guilty as we jumped the line. And Melissa didn&#x2019;t help; she&#x2019;s actually getting quite verbal and testy every time I hop into a wheelchair and make her push me past the pregnant women and sick children. She also says that my little act of rolling my eyes back and shivering and plucking at people&#x2019;s chests and whispering, &#x201c;Say a prayer for me, <i>amigo</i>. The prognosis doesn&#x2019;t look <i>bueno</i>,&#x201d; is a little over the top. I know it upsets her, but boy does it work like a charm.</p><p>I then try to make sure I&#x2019;m not stuck sitting next to some chatty asshole. But I&#x2019;m prepared. I have six Ambien and an intentionally open purse filled with Massengill, Vagisil, Preparation H, a copy of my will, and books on Amelia Earhart and Pan Am Flight 103&#x2019;s surprise landing in Lockerbie.</p><p>JANUARY 8</p><p>Dear Diary:</p><p>One last thing about Anne Frank&#x2019;s diary that was bothering me: the Nazis&#x2014;and <i>their </i>sloppy work ethic. Anne and her entire posse were hidden behind a bookcase for two years and no one found them? Do you know what that means? Nobody ever cleaned or dusted the bookcase, that&#x2019;s what it means! I know there was a war going on and maybe nobody had time to do a white-glove test, but seriously, how much work would it have been to casually walk by with a feather duster or a Swiffer? I find the whole thing shocking; and the thing that shocks me the most is my housekeeper obviously used to be a Nazi.</p><p>JANUARY 9</p><p>Dear Diary:</p><p>Our Mexican vacation is over and I&#x2019;m back in rainy New York. I met my friend Margie for lunch, and in the six blocks from my house to the restaurant, I got splashed on, shoved, banged into and told to &#x201c;go fuck myself&#x201d; in three different languages. And just as I was entering the restaurant, I got shit on by a pigeon. It feels so good to be home.</p><p>JANUARY 10</p><p>Dear Diary:</p><p>I am shaking. This morning I did the &#x201c;Howard Stern Show&#x201d; and it was the most amazing experience I&#x2019;ve ever had on the show. I must&#x2019;ve been a guest on his show a hundred times, but today was the first time ever, ever, ever, in all these years, that Howard never once used the words &#x201c;penis,&#x201d; &#x201c;vagina,&#x201d; &#x201c;midget&#x201d; or &#x201c;retard.&#x201d; It wasn&#x2019;t until later that I found out it was because he had a sore throat. In retaliation, this was the first time I never, never, never once used the words &#x201c;cuntface,&#x201d; &#x201c;turd burglar&#x201d; or &#x201c;Palin.&#x201d;</p><p>JANUARY 11</p><p>Dear Diary:</p><p>Flew to L.A. today to get back to work on <i>Fashion Police</i>. I didn&#x2019;t realize how much I adore taping it. It&#x2019;s been almost a month since I insulted celebrities, shamed lesbos and made fat jokes about Aretha Franklin. I need my fix!</p><p>JANUARY 12</p><p>Dear Diary:</p><p>I spent half the day in the car schlepping all over L.A. going from meeting to meeting, ass-kissing to ass-kissing. My driver listens to the top-rated oldies radio station in L.A., KRTH. It was fun listening for a while, but the station played the same Eddie Money songs over and over and over and over and over again, all day long. No matter where I was in L.A. or what time of day it was, when I got in the car they were playing Eddie.</p><p>I figure since 1960 there must be 100,000 songs to choose from, yet KRTH plays Eddie Money over and over, like an autistic man-child who has to wear a helmet just to eat cereal. I have nothing against Eddie Money; he seems like a lovely man. I met him once a few years ago; he was my waiter at Denny&#x2019;s. But why is KRTH playing him all day, all the time? Is Eddie related to the station owner? Does Eddie have blackmail photos of the program manager fucking a goat? I don&#x2019;t understand it. There are 3.8 million people living in Los Angeles; do any of them call up KRTH every morning and say, &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t play an Eddie Money song at least fifty-eight times today I&#x2019;m going to kill myself&#x201d;? What I <i>could </i>understand is if they called up and said, &#x201c;If you <i>do</i> play Justin Bieber even once, I&#x2019;m going to kill you.&#x201d;</p><p>I wouldn&#x2019;t mind listening to Eddie Money all the time&#x2014;or even Justin Bieber&#x2014;if KRTH would just mix it up a little.

Kennedy, and featuring secret agent Paul Christopher, The Tears of Autumn is a tour de force of action and enigma. Christopher, at the height of his powers, believes he knows who arranged the assassination and why. His theory is so destructive of the legend of the dead president, though, and so dangerous to the survival of foreign policy, that he is ordered to desist from investigating. But Christopher is a man who lives by, and for, the truth, and his internal compunctions force him to the heart of the matter.

How can you eat the carbohydrates you love when you hate the weight you gain when you eat carbohydrates?<br><br>This love-hate relationship often dictates how you try to lose weight. You avoid carbohydrates by going on a high-protein diet. When you go off the diet, carbohydrates are the first foods you reach for and you overeat. Or, when you are stressed, all of your good intentions to watch your carbohydrate intake are tossed aside. It's as though an uncontrollable force pulls you toward anything that is sweet or starchy--or both. As the stress mounts and the �ds are added on, you feel powerless to stop eating the carbohydrates. What are you supposed to do?<br><br>Maybe you never had a weight problem until, like millions of others, you began to take antidepressants. For a reason you can't fathom, you never feel full, no matter how much you eat. Suddenly carbohydrates are the only food you really want. And as you give in to this new craving, your weight goes up. What are you supposed to do?<br><br>At last there is an answer, based on decades of research and clinical experience. You must eat carbohydrates to lose weight and you must eat carbohydrates to maintain the loss.<br><br>THE CARBOHYDRATE-SEROTONIN CONNECTION<br><br>As hard as it may be to believe, carbohydrates are as essential for weight loss as gas is to a car. They not only drive the system that controls appetite, they also control emotional eating and mood.<br><br>At this point many of you who have been told that the road to weight ruin is paved with carbohydrates (especially the yummy ones) are likely reading this in disbelief. How can it be? Don't carbs bulk up fat cells? Shouldn't they be avoided, or at least limited to brown rice, a few leafy vegetables, and occasionally some fruit? How can it be possible to eat pasta, potatoes, rice, and even bread if you want to lose weight? And how can you stop overeating carbohydrates once you start?<br><br>It is not only possible to eat carbohydrates and lose weight, it is essential to do so. The reason lies within your brain.<br><br>Eating carbohydrates triggers a process involving the hormone insulin, an amino acid called tryptophan, and a barrier between the blood and the brain. The net result of this process is the production of a brain chemical called serotonin.<br><br>Serotonin is the switch that turns off your appetite. It is the "I have had enough to eat" switch. Serotonin is also the control that restores your good mood after minor and major stresses erode it. When produced consistently and regularly, serotonin prevents the tendency to eat impulsively when stresses occur.<br><br>Nature seems to have tagged serotonin as the only food-dependent brain chemical. At the same time, nature did you an enormous favor. By being able to manufacture serotonin by eating sweet or starchy carbohydrates, you can tap into a built-in appetite suppressant and mood regulator.<br><br>That's why the Serotonin Power Diet is based on maximizing serotonin production. Our carbohydrate-friendly, serotonin-producing diet will satisfy your appetite even though you will be eating fewer calories. If antidepressants are making you overeat, our diet will give you control over your appetite. It will take away the mental fatigue that keeps you from exercising. And the Serotonin Power Diet will also buffer you when you respond to stresses that otherwise would have you setting a world record for hand-to-mouth eating.<br><br>CARBOHYDRATES 101<br><br>Carbohydrates come in two basic forms: simple and complex. The simple ones, also called sugars (as in table sugar, or sucrose, and milk sugar, or lactose), are made up of one or two molecules. They are digested very quickly into the simplest carbohydrate of all, glucose. Glucose, which circulates in the blood, is the sugar used by muscles for energy. When you exercise, your muscles use a stored form of carbohydrate called glycogen. Marathon runners "carbo-load" before a race to increase the amount of glycogen in their muscles.<br><br>Complex carbohydrates are made up of the same molecules, but in long chains with branches. You know these carbohydrates as starches and eat them as potatoes, pasta, bread, cereal, rice, cornmeal, oats, barley, millet, rye, and other grains. Beans and lentils, although higher in protein than some other carbohydrates, are also included in this family of starches. Complex carbohydrates are also digested into the simplest carbohydrate, glucose, but it takes longer for them to reach this state because of their complexity.<br><br>Thus, all carbohydrates end up as glucose as soon as they leave the intestines and enter the bloodstream. Fruits, which contain fructose, are the exception. Fructose must go through an additional biochemical process in order to be converted into glucose.<br><br>SCIENCE EXPLAINS THE BRAIN-SEROTONIN CONNECTION<br><br>At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the 1970s, Richard Wurtman, MD (Judy's husband), and one of his students made groundbreaking discoveries about the connection between the brain, serotonin, and carbohydrates. They discovered that after animals ate carbohydrates, their brains contained more serotonin.1-4<br><br>The connection between carbohydrates and serotonin was puzzling and quite unexpected. It was already known that serotonin is made when the amino acid tryptophan enters the brain. It was also known that tryptophan is one of many amino acids that make up protein. For instance, tryptophan is found in protein foods such as steak, fish, chicken, and eggs. Tryptophan is not found in carbohydrate foods such as potatoes, bread, and pasta. So it seemed logical that eating protein, not a carbohydrate, would prompt serotonin production.<br><br>But that's not what happened. When laboratory rats were fed a protein meal (such as the protein in milk), their brains made no new serotonin. And when protein was added to a meal containing carbohydrate, no serotonin was made either, even though the rats were eating carbohydrate. It seemed as if eating protein prevented serotonin from being made.<br><br>After the scientific version of "Huh?" was exclaimed, the research team examined how tryptophan gets into the brain from the bloodstream. They knew that there is a barrier around the brain that controls what actually enters the brain from the bloodstream. Some of the substances the brain needs enter through certain "doorways." It was known that tryptophan enters the brain through a particular doorway along with a group of amino acids called neutral amino acids. These amino acids compete with each other to get into the brain through this door the way shoppers compete with each other to be the first ones in the store for the day-after-Christmas sales. The bloodstream fills up with amino acids after protein is eaten and digested. So it seems logical that this would be when a lot of tryptophan gets into the brain. But just the opposite happens. Very little tryptophan gets into the brain because there is less tryptophan in protein than other amino acids. So when the amino acids cluster around the doorway to the brain, the larger number of neutral amino acids squeeze tryptophan out and send it to the back of the crowd. Although some tryptophan may get into the brain, it is not enough to make new serotonin.<br><br>This still left the question, How does tryptophan get into the brain so easily after carbohydrate is eaten? It is as if the manager of the store plucks tryptophan from the back of the crowd and sends it through the doorway first.<br><br>When any carbohydrate is eaten, with the exception of fruit, the hormone insulin is released from the pancreas. (Only trivial amounts of insulin are released in response to dietary fructose.) As digested glucose enters the bloodstream, insulin sends it into the organs of the body, where it is used as energy. Within several minutes the level of glucose in the blood returns to pre-meal levels.<br><br>As insulin pushes the glucose into the organs, it also sends amino acids out of the blood into the organs. Tryptophan is also sent away--but not as fast as the other amino acids. Think of that crowd in front of the store. The people pushing to get in melt away, leaving only one person to walk easily through the doorway. Tryptophan no longer has any difficulty getting into the brain. Once in the brain, it is quickly converted into serotonin.<br><br>Dr. Richard Wurtman, Judy, and their colleagues concluded after further research that eating carbohydrate is the only way tryptophan can get into the brain to make serotonin.<br><br>Why is this important for you to know? Because, as Judy's later research found, as serotonin is made it begins to turn off your appetite and make you content with eating less. It turns on your good mood and makes you resistant to stress-triggered overeating. And serotonin can make you feel more energetic.<br><br>THE SEROTONIN-APPETITE CONNECTION<br><br>It wasn't always obvious that serotonin is involved in regulating eating. People used to believe that when the stomach filled up, eating would stop. (Of course anyone who has consumed dessert despite feeling stuffed from the main course would dispute this assumption.)<br><br>After the initial serotonin studies were completed, Judy and her colleagues at MIT conducted further research to determine if cravings for sweet and starchy foods were related to serotonin and carbohydrates.<br><br>The work was not done in isolation; much research done elsewhere in the United States and in Europe showed that the brain contained the master switch to turn off eating.<br><br>Judy's first set of studies on laboratory animals showed that when brain serotonin was made more active, the animals stopped eating.5-7 After animals were treated with drugs that increased serotonin's activity, their food intake was compared to that of animals treated with a placebo.<br><br>The treated animals stopped eating much sooner than the animals who did not take these drugs. These studies were done many times to make sure that the results were valid. It was very exciting to find that the brain, and not the full stomach, was able to turn off eating.<br><br>Then Judy's team wondered what would happen if animals did not have enough serotonin in their brains. Normally, laboratory animals eat a great deal of carbohydrate, so presumably their brains were able to make new serotonin at any time. Would the animals eat differently if their daily carbohydrate were taken away from them? Would the absence of carbohydrate and the absence of serotonin have any effect on how much they ate? Might they exhibit the animal version of a binge?<br><br>To find out, rats were given the same number of calories they usually received, but the food contained only protein and fat. They were not allowed to eat any carbohydrate. The rats stayed on this rodent version of the Atkins Diet for 3 weeks. Other rats were given normal rat food, which contained carbohydrate as well as protein and fat, for the same period of time. After the 3 weeks were over, both groups were given three dishes of food. One dish contained protein, the second held fat, and the third contained a mixture of starch and sugar.<br><br>The rats that had been allowed to eat carbohydrates in the previous 3 weeks continued to do so, taking a small amount of food from all three dishes.<br><br>Things were different for the carbohydrate-deprived rats. They binged on the carbohydrates, ignoring the protein and fat. Rats normally do not binge. Rats always control what they eat. Something had happened.<br><br>The research team found that there was very little tryptophan or serotonin in the rats' brains. The few weeks of a no-carbohydrate diet had prevented serotonin from being made. And as a result, not only were the animals eating more than they usually ate, they were actually seeking out carbohydrate. Was the brain telling them what to eat to restore depleted serotonin levels?<br><br>If so, the brain succeeded in this case. By the next day the formerly carbohydrate-starved rats were eating as they had before the experiment. It seemed that their serotonin levels were back to normal.<br><br>But was this also true of people? Would their serotonin levels and their eating also be affected by the lack of carbohydrates? To find out, human volunteers at MIT were recruited to go on a carbohydrate-free diet. Their blood was tested for amino acid levels that would tell whether serotonin was or wasn't being made in their brains.<br><br>The findings were not surprising. The blood tests confirmed that very little tryptophan could get into the brain to make new serotonin. And the lack of serotonin had an impact on how the volunteers felt. They craved carbohydrates constantly and complained about not feeling full, even though they were getting more than enough food.<br><br>But scientists have to be skeptical. Maybe the volunteers just missed the tastes and textures of carbohydrates, which would explain why they grumbled about not feeling satisfied. It might not have been due to the lack of serotonin at all.<br><br>The only way to tell whether their feelings of deprivation were caused by their brains or their taste buds was to change serotonin activity in their brains without telling them.<br><br>It was decided to see if the volunteers still had their cravings when serotonin activity was increased in the brain with a research drug. The volunteers were given either a test medication or a placebo without their knowing which treatment they were taking. If their cravings for carbohydrate decreased after being treated with the test drug and they felt as satisfied as they would have if they had eaten, the researchers could be reasonably sure that these feelings were due to changes in serotonin and not taste buds.<br><br>Several studies showed that volunteers treated with the placebo did not experience any decrease in their appetite or carbohydrate cravings. On the other hand, the volunteers who were treated with the test medication experienced decreased carbohydrate cravings. One volunteer said, "I used to polish off the leftovers before they were carried to the kitchen. But for a couple of weeks I couldn't even finish what was on my plate. I learned later that those were the weeks when I was taking the drug."<br><br>These experiments, and others like them, suggested that serotonin is the key to controlling appetite so that people can stick to the portion sizes of a diet without difficulty. Serotonin is also the key to minimizing cravings for sweet and starchy snack foods, the downfall of many a dieter.<br><br>And nature revealed the perfect diet tool to manipulate serotonin: carbohydrates. To lose weight, no drugs, supplements, or strange food combinations--or side effects--are necessary. Carbohydrate snacks, however, are welcome.<br><br>SNACKS: YOUR UNEXPECTED ALLY<br><br>From the studies' conclusions, we guessed that carbohydrate snacks would help control appetite, reduce cravings, and prevent overeating when emotionally upset. Before making the snacks an essential part of the Serotonin Power Diet, we tested our theory.<br><br>Studies were done with obese volunteers who wanted to lose weight. All of the volunteers were told they would be given one of two drinks that contained the same number of calories. One was composed solely of carbohydrate and the other contained carbohydrate and protein. They were told that one drink would increase serotonin and might cut back their appetite and food intake while the other would not likely have any impact.</p><h2>Johnny, We Hardly Knew Ye: Memories of John Fitzgerald Kennedy</h2><p>A memoir about JFK and the &#34; Irish Mafia &#34;</p><p>Kenneth P. O&#x2019;Donnell(1924&#x2013;1977)was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, in March 1924, and was the founding member of what the press dubbed the &#x201c;Boston Irish Mafia,&#x201d; which also included David F. Powers and Larry O&#x2019;Brien. His father was the famed Holy Cross football coach Cleo O&#x2019;Donnell. Kenneth O&#x2019;Donnell became a bombardier pilot, a war hero, and a graduate of Harvard University, where he played football with Robert F. Kennedy. He was later inducted into Harvard&#x2019;s football hall of fame, and many of his records remain unbroken to this day.<br>O&#x2019;Donnell met John F. Kennedy in 1946, and through his relationship with Bobby Kennedy, became John Kennedy&#x2019;s top political aide from that point forward. During the 1960 political campaign, he worked hand in glove with Jack and Robert Kennedy as they developed the &#x201c;Kennedy machine&#x201d; and drove it to victory.<br><br>Once in the White House, John Kennedy named O&#x2019;Donnell special assistant and appointment secretary; nobody got to see Jack Kennedy without first going through O&#x2019;Donnell. He was with Kennedy that fateful afternoon in Dallas, Texas, in 1963.<br><br>After Kennedy&#x2019;s death, O&#x2019;Donnell stayed on for one year in the same role with then-president Lyndon Johnson. He also became executive director of the Democratic National Committee and is credited with helping to create the modern DNC. He later left Washington to return to Boston, where he ran for governor in 1966, losing in a very tight race. Later, as a political consultant, he worked with senators Robert F. Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey. He remained close to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis throughout his life, helping her to establish the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum. He also remained a close friend and advisor to Bobby Kennedy. O&#x2019;Donnell collaborated with Dave Powers on the now-classic memoir <i>Johnny, We Hardly Knew Ye</i>. O&#x2019;Donnell was later made famous in the film <i>Thirteen Days</i>, in which his relationship with Jack and Bobby Kennedy is accurately portrayed by Kevin Costner. O&#x2019;Donnell died in September 1977 at the age of fifty-three.<br><br>David F. Powers (1912&#x2013;1998) was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts, in April 1912. He is best remembered as a congenial, spirited, funny Boston Irishman who, along with Kenneth O&#x2019;Donnell and the late Larry O&#x2019;Brien, made up the original &#x201c;Boston Irish Mafia.&#x201d; He also happened to be one of President John F. Kennedy&#x2019;s best friends. The two met in the winter of 1946, when Kennedy, then a young and largely unknown Congressional candidate, famously climbed the stairs of Powers&#x2019;s triple-decker house in Charlestown and asked for his help. The two formed an immediate bond. Powers was likely at Jack Kennedy&#x2019;s side from that night until the fateful afternoon in Dallas in November 1963. He had no particular duties with Kennedy, but Kennedy always knew that he had his back. In the White House, Powers was named special assistant to the president, and he served to provide a much-needed humorous lift during some of the president&#x2019;s most difficult days. After Kennedy&#x2019;s death, Powers remained close with Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and their children. From 1964 forward, he worked hand in glove with Mrs. Onassis to establish the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum and rightly went on to become its first curator. He and Kenneth O&#x2019;Donnell penned the book <i>Johnny, We Hardly Knew Ye</i>, which has become a classic. Powers died in 1998 at the age of eighty-five.</p><h2>Ecce And Old Earth</h2><p>Glawen Clattuc, scion of one of the scientific houses of Cadwal, must discover which humans are sabotaging his planet, protected by law and covenant against colonization and exploitation. Reprint.</p><p>YA-- A story that has the broad appeal of Niven's Ringworld (Ballantine, 1985), Herbert's Dune (Berkeley, 1985), and Heinlein's best, with overtones of Indiana Jones. When humans first colonized ``The Gaian Reach,'' the rich planet Cadwal was established as a nature conservancy. Now, many generations later, some residents of one continent are attempting to throw the Conservators out of office and open the planet to settlement. When it is discovered that a crucial document is missing, the opposing factions embark on a treasure hunt that spans the known galaxy, to Old Earth and back out again. Contemporary concerns such as ecology, politics, individual behavior, gender, and language are all lively features of Vance's universe and crucial to the plot. One of the novel's most delightful aspects is a narrative structure in which a young couple pursue the quest independently, separated (temporarily) but equal. The heroine has a wry wit and intelligent self-possession. Because of this and many other rich characterizations, the book should appeal even to readers usually reluctant to try the genre. Although this is a sequel to Araminta Station (Tor, 1988), it stands on its own. An elegant 18-page ``Precursory'' presents the needed synopsis.<br><i>-Christine C. Menefee, Fairfax County Public Library, VA</i><br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.Vance's rich lyrical style makes this follow-up to Araminta Station a pleasure to read. The planet Cadwal, established long before as a Conservancy--a natural preserve protected from settlement and development--is threatened by powerful factions that want to open its resources to exploitation. The threat becomes urgent when the Conservators learn that the ancient Charter guaranteeing Cadwal's status is missing and that anti-conservationists have already begun their search for it. Hoping to preempt them, two young Conservators, Glawen Clattuc and Wayness Tamm, decide to head for Old Earth. When Glawen is delayed on Cadwal, Wayness goes first, becoming a sort of country-hopping Nancy Drew as she follows the Charter's decades-cold trail around the globe. Glawen, meanwhile, armed with new information, pursues the Charter from another angle, and events carry the pair toward an exciting, climactic reunion. This intelligent, entertaining diversion is more detective story than science fiction: except for a startling lack of central government, Old Earth differs little from our day, serving as a mere backdrop for Wayness's Charter chase. But she and Glawen are likable protagonists engaged in colorful adventures. Not one of Vance's very best, but even minor Vance is provocative and fun. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Queen Esther&#39;s Secrets of Womanhood: A Biblical Rite of Passage for Your Daughter</h2><p>Mindful of the time constraints of everyday living, Ginger Garrett has put together an entire year of juicy discussions and pampering pleasures for mothers and daughters.

Alcazar is again facing trouble from his rival, General Tapioca, and numerous other characters from the past weave themselves into the story. While <i>Tintin and the Picaros</i> is entertaining, Herge was slow to finish it, and his world-weariness is reflected in the attitudes of some of the characters. <i>--David Horiuchi</i>Herge (Georges Remi) was born in Brussels in 1907. Over the course of 54 years he completed 23 albums of The Adventures of Tintin series, which is now considered to be one of the greatest, if not the greatest, comics series of all time. With translations published in over 80 languages, more than 230 million copies sold worldwide and a Hollywood movie to its name, Tintin dominates the Comics and Graphic Novels chart even today. Sadly, Herge died in 1983, leaving his 24th album, Tintin and Alph-Art, unfinished, but his hero continues to be one of the most iconic characters in both adult and children&#39;s fiction.</p><h2>10 Things Pope Francis Wants You to Know</h2><p><p>Since his election, Pope Francis has captured the attention of media and the people.

Wonderfully written and including some brilliant original photography from their journeys, Charles&#39; diaries describe the feeling of being able to travel on the new roads of Britain without the dangers of heavy traffic, and of an age when time moved at a more peaceful pace.</p><p>Charles James Pope was born in 1879 in Hammersmith, London, and was part of the generation of cyclists who cycled in a golden era, the time of pioneer cycling writer Wayfarer and of the Cycle Club.

"Two of them were in the White House," and not about to talk, while McDougal's ex-husband, Jim, lacked credibility, leaving her as the sole credible witness. The problem was that nobody in the media or the office of independent counsel Ken Starr wanted to hear what she had to say: that Whitewater was just "a stupid land deal that went bad," and the McDougals weren't all that close to the Clintons anyway. McDougal offers up her full life story, including an Arkansas childhood and the raunchy antics of the Clinton-run statehouse, and details her turbulent marriage to Jim McDougal, exacerbated by his long-undiagnosed manic-depression. But she knows that readers want to learn about-her experiences being grilled, then jailed for contempt for refusing to give Starr his smoking gun-and she lays on the horrific details with righteous fury. She also recalls positive experiences with fellow inmates and supportive friends (and strangers) on her way to eventual vindication, and looks back on her travails with humor. Several personalities around "Clintongate" rushed their books out to take advantage of their fleeting notoriety and, in some cases, the rising anti-Clinton tide; McDougal's delay gives her account a historical and emotional perspective many of her predecessors lacked. Still, with Clinton out of the White House and the public's attention turned on Iraq, this book's sales may suffer from bad timing. Eight pages of b&amp;w photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.Whitewater figure Susan McDougal was one of the most controversial, if peripheral, players during the Clinton-era scandals. When she refused to answer questions posed by Ken Starr's lawyers in front of a grand jury, she was held in civil contempt and sent to jail. This tactic, meant to force cooperation, backfired. McDougal spent 21 months in jail and became the poster girl for the excesses and overreaching of the Office of the Independent Counsel (OIC). McDougal begins her story in small-town Arkansas, where she grew up; her troubles began when she married the charismatic, eccentric Jim McDougal at age 20 and became a partner in his successful real-estate business. McDougal doesn't come away looking totally clean in this tale; her recounting of her relationship with conductor Zubin Mehta's wife, in particular, seems self-serving. But if half of her dealings with Starr's lawyers are as she states, this book starkly shows what happens to people who stand up against government coercion. There are some fresh takes on Bill Clinton (she was never his lover, although the OIC wanted her to admit to that), and her views on how prison changed her for the better add texture to an interestingly told tale. Expect to see McDougal on the talk-show circuit. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

And what political situations, what religious and cultural prejudices in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries gave rise to this confusion? Taking up these questions, John O'Malley works out a remarkable guide to the intellectual and historical developments behind the concepts of Catholic reform, the Counter Reformation, and, in his felicitous term, Early Modern Catholicism. The result is the single best overview of scholarship on Catholicism in early modern Europe, delivered in a pithy, lucid, and entertaining style. Although its subject is fundamental to virtually all other issues relating to sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe, there is no other book like this in any language. </p><p> More than a historiographical review, <i>Trent and All That</i> makes a compelling case for subsuming the present confusion of terminology under the concept of Early Modern Catholicism. The term indicates clearly what this book so eloquently demonstrates: that Early Modern Catholicism was an aspect of early modern history, which it strongly influenced and by which it was itself in large measure determined. As a reviewer commented, O'Malley's discussion of terminology "opens up a different way of conceiving of the whole history of Catholicism between the Reformation and the French Revolution." </p></p><p>John W. O&#x2019;Malley is University Professor at Georgetown University."There is no other comparable book or even article that deals with the same material in such a full and historically accurate way. O'Malley is the first to put a vast amount of scholarship together in a clear, cogent, and authoritative fashion. He has the kind of profound knowledge and understanding of historiography that comes only after years of study. Given the scope of the book, it should be most useful for courses not only on the Reformation, but on early modern Europe in general.

O'Malley is a leading authority and provides here the most significant and well-documented overview of this issue and its scholarship...In the end, O'Malley proposes his own candidate for the best name for the period. Yet, this is not his primary goal alone.

He is the author of <i>Pararescue: The Skill and Courage of the Elite 106th Rescue Wing: The True Story of an Incredible Rescue at Sea and the Heroes Who Pulled It Off</i>.A cross between Green Berets and 911 paramedics, Air Force pararescuemen-PJs for short-parachute or helicopter in, sometimes under fire, to treat and evacuate sick or wounded soldiers. Narrowly specialized, highly trained and bound by the credo "That Others May Live," PJs are the embodiment of the hyper-professionalism and leave-no-comrade-behind ethos of today's military. This gung-ho and often gripping account celebrates their exploits in the war in Afghanistan. Investigative reporter Hirsh loves to shoot the breeze with PJs while they regale him with anecdotes, brag about their maniacal training regimen and disparage other commando units, especially the Navy SEALs ("We don't think the world revolves around us," says one PJ. "Whereas the SEALs do"). Sometimes Hirsch lets his subjects go on too long, giving readers an all too vivid impression of a torpid day at the base. But when the action starts, he depicts their harrowing adventures with verve and insight, writing in a laconic, acronym-heavy military-ese that aptly conveys the cool-headed grit with which soldiers cope with the chaos of combat ("Captain Self began to sense that the shrapnel wound in his right thigh was going to cause mobility problems as the day wore on"). A Vietnam vet himself, Hirsh retains a certain scorn for the brass, especially when they evince a lack of faith in the PJ's ability to get the job done. Full of special-ops procedural, you-are-there detail, and moments of real pathos as soldiers confront the horrors of war, this book will delight military buffs. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Diego Rodriguez de Silva y Velasquez (Art for Children (Lippencott))</h2><p>A brief biography of the seventeenth-century Spanish painter accompanies fifteen color reproductions and critical interpretations of his works.</p><p></p><h2>Alchemy and Academe</h2><p>An enchanting collection of tales, enchantments, things magical and strange, devils and demons, professors of potent powers, witchcraft and wizardry, and more.

Robert Oppenheimer, his friend Isidor Rabi once remarked, was &#x201c;a man who was put together of many bright shining splinters,&#x201d; who &#x201c;never got to be an integrated personality.&#x201d; What prevented Oppenheimer from being fully integrated, Rabi thought, was his denial of a centrally important part of himself: his Jewishness. As the physicist Felix Bloch, echoing Rabi, once put it, Oppenheimer &#x201c;tried to act as if he were not a Jew and succeeded well because he was a good actor.&#x201d; And, because he was always acting (&#x201c;you carried on a charade with him. He lived a charade,&#x201d; Rabi once remarked), he lost sight of who he really was. Oppenheimer had an impressive and wide-ranging collection of talents, abilities and personal characteristics, but where the central, united core of his personality ought to have been, Rabi thought, there was a gap and so there was nothing to hold those &#x201c;bright shining splinters&#x201d; together. &#x201c;I understood his problem,&#x201d; Rabi said, and, when asked what that problem was, replied simply: &#x201c;Identity.&#x201d;<br><br>Rabi spoke as someone who, by virtue of his background, intelligence and education, was well placed to understand Oppenheimer&#x2019;s &#x201c;problem.&#x201d; He and Oppenheimer had a great deal in common: they were roughly the same age (Rabi was six years older), they were both theoretical physicists, were both brought up in New York City and were both descended from European Jewish families. Behind this last similarity, however, lay a fundamental difference. Rabi was proud of his Jewish inheritance and happy to define himself in terms of it. Though he had no religious beliefs, and never prayed, he once said that when he saw Orthodox Jews at prayer, the thought that came into his mind was: &#x201c;These are my people.&#x201d;<br><br>No such thought could have entered Oppenheimer&#x2019;s mind, no matter who he was looking at. There was no group to whom he could point and say, &#x201c;These are my people,&#x201d; and not just because of his ambivalence about his Jewish background. It was also because that background itself, regardless of Oppenheimer&#x2019;s feelings about it, could not have provided him with the sense of belonging and, therefore, the sense of identity that Rabi thought was missing in him. Rabi, despite his lack of religious beliefs, was Jewish in a fairly straightforward and unambiguous way; the Jews simply were &#x201c;his people.&#x201d; Theirs was the community to which he belonged. One cannot say the same about Oppenheimer. The sense in which he was Jewish, the sense in which he did--and did not--come from, and belong to, a Jewish community, is far more complicated and, as Rabi has perceptively noted, crucial in understanding the fragility of his sense of identity.<br><br>For an understanding of the elusive nature of Oppenheimer&#x2019;s Jewishness, the contrast between his family background and Rabi&#x2019;s is instructive. Despite their many and important similarities, and despite the fact that they grew up within a few miles of each other, Rabi and Oppenheimer were born into and brought up in families that were culturally worlds apart. Rabi was a &#x201c;Polish Jew.&#x201d; Born in Galicia to a poor, Yiddish-speaking family of Orthodox Jews, he came to New York as an infant and was raised, first in the crowded slums of the Lower East Side and then in a tiny apartment in Brooklyn. Oppenheimer was born not in Europe, but in New York City, to a wealthy family that had abandoned its Jewish faith and traditions a generation earlier. The bustling and crowded &#x201c;Jewish Ghetto&#x201d; of the Lower East Side would have seemed utterly alien to the young Oppenheimer, who was brought up in an enormous luxury apartment in the genteel Upper West Side. The family had never spoken Yiddish, and, though German was his father&#x2019;s first language, it was never spoken at home.<br><br>And yet, despite regarding himself as neither German nor Jewish, Oppenheimer was seen, by Jews and non-Jews alike, as a &#x201c;German Jew.&#x201d; In New York in the early twentieth century the central division among the Jewish community was between, on the one hand, the German Jews and, on the other, the Polish and Russian Jews--the differences between the two groups accurately mirrored by the differences between Oppenheimer and Rabi. The German Jews, sometimes called &#x201c;Uptown Jews,&#x201d; were on the whole wealthier, more assimilated and less religious than their Polish and Russian counterparts, to whom they were notoriously condescending. At the time of Oppenheimer&#x2019;s birth in 1904 there were more Polish and Russian Jews in New York than German Jews, but the Germans assumed leadership of the Jewish community and took it upon themselves to help &#x201c;Americanize&#x201d; the Russians and Poles, who reacted with resentment at what they saw as a dismissal of their religion and their customs.<br><br>What Rabi called Oppenheimer&#x2019;s problem--the problem of identity--was, in fact, a problem for the entire American Jewish community, perhaps its central problem. Certainly it was the issue at the heart of the tension between the two groups of Jews in New York City. For the Russian and Polish Jews, their sense of identity was bound up with their Jewishness: their Orthodox religious beliefs, their Yiddish language and their Jewish culture and traditions. That sense of identity, that culture, however, had been abandoned by the German Jews before they even came to America.<br><br>The mass migration of German Jews to America that occurred in the mid-nineteenth century was intimately bound up with their earlier abandonment of the traditional trappings of Jewish identity. Haskalah, the Jewish Enlightenment of the late eighteenth century, was an essentially German movement, its prophet being the great Prussian Jewish thinker Moses Mendelssohn. Haskalah, which led in turn to that other essentially German movement, Reform Judaism, encouraged Jews to, literally and metaphorically, leave the ghettos in which they had been confined and embrace the modernizing ideas of the wider Western European Enlightenment. This meant using German rather than Hebrew as the language of worship, abandoning traditions and customs that served to isolate Jews from the rest of society, and reforming Jewish education so that it prepared people for the world at large rather than schooling them in a separate culture. The hope that inspired these changes was that, in return for abandoning those aspects of their culture that identified them as radically different from others, the Jews would receive from the gentile world a lifting of the discriminatory laws that affected almost every aspect of their lives, and a full acceptance as members of society with the same legal, financial and political rights as other citizens. Thus fully assimilated, Jews would no longer think of themselves as a separate race or nation, but rather as adherents of a religion. Their nationality would be German, and they would be not a bit less German for worshipping in a synagogue rather than a church.<br><br>It was the dashing of this hope that persuaded hundreds of thousands of German Jews in the middle decades of the nineteenth century to turn their backs on their home country and look to America--a country founded upon the proposition that the equality of all men and the inalienability of the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness were self-evident truths--to find the freedom and equality they had failed to achieve in Germany. Thus, in the eyes of German Jews, America became not only a refuge from discrimination and prejudice, but also the national embodiment of Enlightenment ideals, the ideals of Haskalah. Many of them therefore ceased trying to become accepted as Germans and sought instead to become accepted as Americans.<br><br>&#x201c;Amerika, du hast es besser.&#x201d; These famous words of Goethe are contained in the poem &#x201c;Den Vereinigten Staaten&#x201d; (&#x201c;To the United States&#x201d;), written in 1827, when, as an old man, he reflected upon the advantages that youthful America had over the &#x201c;Old Continent&#x201d; in having no tradition, no &#x201c;decaying castles,&#x201d; and being therefore free from the continuous strife that comes from long memories. The image of America that Goethe&#x2019;s poem conjures up is one of a tabula rasa, waiting, so to speak, to have its history written upon it. This was an image perfectly suited to arouse the interest and expectations of the German Jews, a group who longed to start afresh, free from the tensions and prejudices of the past.<br><br>And so, beginning in the 1820s, the rallying cry &#x201c;On to America&#x201d; echoed throughout the Jewish community in Germany. A whole movement grew up dedicated to the encouragement of migration to the United States, publicizing the financial, social and political advantages of the New World, and providing hope and support to those prepared to make what must have been an alarming as well as an exciting fresh start. In books by Europeans who had been to America, in letters to relatives from those who had migrated, and in village meetings where people gathered to hear firsthand accounts of American life from migrants who had returned to visit families, the image of America as &#x201c;the common man&#x2019;s utopia&#x201d; was spread, inspiring more and more Jews to set sail for the United States.<br><br>A typical example of such inspirational firsthand accounts is a letter written in November 1846 by the journalist and academic Max Lilienthal, which was published in the German Jewish weekly newspaper Allgemeine Zeitung des Judenthums. Extolling &#x201c;the beautiful ground of civil equality&#x201d; that he had discovered in America, Lilienthal announced: &#x201c;The old Europe with its restrictions lies behind me like a bad dream . . . At last I breathe in liberty . . . Jew or Christian, Christian or Jew--this old strife is forgotten, and only the man as such is respected and loved.&#x201d; Encouraging others to follow his example, he urged: &#x201c;Shake off the centuries-old dust of Jew-pressure . . . become a human being like everybody else.&#x201d; And, he promised, in America: &#x201c;Jewish hearts are open in welcome. Jewish organisations ready to help anyone. Why should you go on carrying the burden of legal exclusion?&#x201d;<br><br>The number of German Jews willing and eager to &#x201c;shake off the centuries-old dust of Jew-pressure&#x201d; was so large that it completely transformed the American Jewish community. In 1840, there were just 15,000 Jews in the United States; by 1880, there were 280,000, most of whom were of German origin. This influx of German Jews is known to Jewish historians as the &#x201c;Second Migration&#x201d;--the &#x201c;First Migration&#x201d; being the arrival in the seventeenth century of a small community of Sephardic Jews. These were descendants of the Jews expelled from Spain and Portugal in the fifteenth century, who, by the nineteenth century, were a well-established part of American life.<br><br>These self-styled &#x201c;old American Sephardic families&#x201d; took pride in the fact that they had been in America for as many generations as the descendants of the Pilgrim Fathers, and tended to treat the new German arrivals with the kind of lofty disdain with which the German Jews would later treat the Russians and Poles. The first German Jews to arrive in America accepted the leadership of the old Sephardic community and even adopted the Sephardic form of worship. When the number of German Jewish migrants began to increase dramatically, however, the balance of power shifted and the German, Ashkenazi Jews replaced the Sephardim as the leaders of the American Jewish community.<br><br>The mass influx into America of Russian and Polish Jews, which took place from 1880 to 1920, formed the &#x201c;Third Migration,&#x201d; and was on an entirely different scale from the previous two, being measured not in tens of thousands, or in hundreds of thousands, but in millions. Roughly two and a half million Jews from Eastern Europe arrived in the United States during the Third Migration, bringing with them a very different kind of Jewish culture from that of either the Sephardim or the Germans.<br><br>The arrival of these Russian and Polish Jews was such an embarrassment to the established German Jewish community that their first reaction to it was to argue, through editorials in their newspaper, American Hebrew, and direct lobbying from their organization, the United Hebrew Charities of New York, for the introduction of tougher immigration laws. When this came to nothing and the number of Eastern European Jewish immigrants kept rising, the German Jews set up the Education Alliance, which organized Americanization programs in which the new immigrants were instructed in &#x201c;the privileges and duties of American citizenship.&#x201d; What drove these measures was not only the German Jews&#x2019; love of America, but also a dread of the anti-Semitism which they feared the Eastern European Jews would arouse. The Jewish historian Gerald Sorin points out: &#x201c;These uptowners were very taken with Israel Zangwill&#x2019;s play &#x2018;The Melting Pot.&#x2019; They saw in it a reinforcement of their own proposed solution for the problems of downtown: the sooner immigrants from eastern Europe gave up their cultural distinctiveness and melted into the homogenized mass, the sooner anti-Semitism would also melt.&#x201d;<br><br>It was a strategy that German Jews had tried unsuccessfully in Germany, but which seemed to be working in the United States. It required, however, constant vigilance with respect to &#x201c;cultural distinctiveness,&#x201d; a vigilance that could easily slip into the kind of self-denial of which Rabi accused Oppenheimer. One form this vigilance took was an acute sensitivity among German Jews about their names. Sometimes this led to the abandonment of German-sounding surnames, a notable example being August Schonberg, the son of an impoverished Jewish family from the Rhineland, who would become famous as the millionaire New York banker August Belmont. More often, though, it took the form of changing one&#x2019;s first name and giving to one&#x2019;s children names that sounded reassuringly &#x201c;American.&#x201d; Joseph Seligman, another millionaire New York banker, brought his brothers, Wolfgang, Jacob and Isaias, over from Germany, but on arrival they became William, James and Jesse. The names of Joseph Seligman&#x2019;s children look like a roll call of American heroes: George Washington Seligman, Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman and Alfred Lincoln Seligman (evidently &#x201c;Abraham&#x201d; was considered too Judaic).<br><br>Of the American heroes commemorated in these names, the least well known today is undoubtedly Robert Anderson. He was a major in the U.S. army at the time of the outbreak of the Civil War in April 1861 and was involved in the opening hostilities, when Fort Sumter in South Carolina, which was then under his command, came under fire from the Confederates. For holding his ground and defending the fort for thirty-four hours Major Anderson was promoted by Abraham Lincoln to Brigadier General and became a national hero, not just for the duration of the war, but also for many decades afterward. Because of him, the name &#x201c;Robert&#x201d; became immensely popular. For anyone wanting to affirm the American identity of their offspring, it was the natural choice. Indeed J. Robert Oppenheimer was to like it so much that he ignored the &#x201c;J&#x201d; in his name and was known, by family and friends, simply as &#x201c;Robert&#x201d; or &#x201c;Bob.&#x201d; When he was asked what the &#x201c;J&#x201d; stood for, he would reply that it stood for nothing. In fact, as his birth certificate shows, it stands for &#x201c;Julius,&#x201d; his father&#x2019;s name. For anyone striving to avoid &#x201c;cultural distinctiveness,&#x201d; the name &#x201c;Robert Oppenheimer,&#x201d; or even &#x201c;J. Robert Oppenheimer,&#x201d; had obvious advantages over &#x201c;Julius Oppenheimer.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Turning Point: Thirty-Five Years in this Century, the Autobiography of Klaus Mann</h2><p>Klaus Mann, writer of Mephisto and the oldest son of Nobel Prize winner Thomas Mann, describes the life of intellectuals in Europe before the Nazi seizure of power, then moves on to depict the restless existence of the often bohemian literary circles of writers in Paris, Zurich, Amsterdam, New York, and Hollywood in the 30s and 40s.</p><p></p><h2>DC Universe: Inheritance</h2><p>The award-winning author of the &#34;Batman: Gotham Knights&#34; comic pens this second book in an explosive four-book series featuring the greatest comic book heroes from the DC universe.

For those who are not such geeks, then the basic bits of essential knowledge, all to be found in his pages, are these: The studio was built in the heart of St. John&#39;s Wood, &#34;London&#39;s first garden suburb,&#34; in a refitted Georgian mansion, and in those august surroundings was inaugurated under the baton of none other than Edward Elgar, he of &#34;Pomp and Circumstance&#34; fame. It was also a sonic laboratory, a place to test not only gear to help King George VI work through his stutter (the stuff of the hit movie The King&#39;s Speech) but also the stereophonic, aurally deceptive goodies that would be put to use in the psychedelic era under the tutelage of good Sir George Martin. Before all that, though, Abbey Road had to make the transition from stuffy classical facility to pop wonderland. If you knew that the first pop hit to emerge from Abbey Road was &#34;Cowpuncher&#39;s Cantata&#34; in 1952, then you will not need or profit from Lawrence&#39;s considerable labors, but if you did not-or did not know that Pink Floyd, Radiohead and even Mel Gibson recorded here-then this book is certainly worthy of time and exploration. One might quibble with some of his assessments (Was Jeff Beck&#39;s Truth really a forerunner of metal? Were the Hollies really just another cover band?), but Lawrence makes up for it with plenty of fine factual writing, especially on the technological side. Lucid and lavishly illustrated-a fine gift for pop and music history buffs. * Kirkus *</p><h2>Warman&#39;s Bean Plush Field Guide: Values and Identification (Warman&#39;s Field Guide)</h2><p>With thousands of new beanies appearing on the market daily, collectors are finding it difficult to keep track of what they have, what they don?t have, and what they cannot wait to get their hands on.

Schwenk,&nbsp; <i>Princess Ben, </i>and<i> Wisdom's Kiss.</i></p>How often indeed I have pondered the hand fate would have dealt me had I accompanied my parents that dismal spring morning. Such musings, I concede, are naught but the near side of madness, for envisioning what might have been has no more connection to our own true reality than a lunatic has to a lemon. Nevertheless, particularly in those morose interludes that at times overburden even the most jovial of souls, my thoughts return to my dear mother and father, and again I marvel at the utter unpredictability of life, and the truth that our futures are so often determined not by some grand design or deliberate strategy but by the mundane capriciousness of a head cold. To be candid, my sickness did not occur completely by chance. I had exhausted myself in preparing for my fifteenth birthday fete the week before, had gorged myself during the festivities on far too many sweets, and had then caught a chill during a lengthy game of stags and hunters with my party guests in the twilight forest. Now, however, denying all my symptoms, I endeavored to join my parents. I have to go!&#x201d; I insisted from my bed. It&#x2019;s my grandfather.&#x201d; My mother sighed. Your grandfather would never approve of his granddaughter of all people making herself twice as ill on his account.&#x201d; She replaced the cloth, soaked in her own herbal concoction, on my forehead, and coaxed some tea across my lips. Why don&#x2019;t you draw him a picture instead? I promise to leave it in a place of honor.&#x201d; A picture?&#x201d; I scoffed. I wish you&#x2019;d realize I&#x2019;m not a child.&#x201d; She kissed my flushed cheeks with a smile. Try to sleep, darling. We&#x2019;ll be back before dusk.&#x201d; These words, too, I ponder. My indignation notwithstanding, all evidence demonstrated that I was still very much a child. After all, I had brought this illness upon myself. Worse, I had sensed the head cold brewing yet petulantly refused to follow my mother&#x2019;s advice, so sacrificing that pinch of prevention for cup after cup of homemade cure. My bedroom was crowded with stacks of fairy tales, many of the pages illuminated with my own crude drawings, and dolls in myriad displays of dishabille. How easy it would have been for my mother indeed, were the tables turned, I would have so responded without hesitation to point out my childishness. I told you so may be painless to utter, but that does not diminish the anguish these four words inflict upon a listener already in pain. That my mother held her tongue and gave me only love when I merited chiding demonstrates her empathy. So many times in the decades since I have reminded myself of her innate compassion, and on my best days have striven to match it. At the time, though, I simply sulked, and so my father found me as he strode in to wish me well. Even in the gloom of that overcast morning, he looked magnificent, his dress armor polished to a high gleam and his prince&#x2019;s circlet, excavated from the woolen trunks for its semiannual outing, shining against his graying curls. He settled on my bedside with a clank or two. &#x2019;Tis a great shame you can&#x2019;t join us today.&#x201d; I pouted. I could go. If you let me.&#x201d; And have your mother put my head on a stake? Do you have any notion what that would do to my handsome good looks?&#x201d; I refused to be cheered. He eyed me with a twinkle. What if I returned with a dragon?&#x201d; Through enormous focus, I maintained my glower. A wee green one that whistled like a kettle? It could roast chestnuts for you on winter mornings.&#x201d; Despite my best efforts, up crept the corners of my mouth. And warm your chilblains when you&#x2019;re old,&#x201d; I added.<br> Ben,&#x2019; I&#x2019;d call out, where&#x2019;s that blasted dragon of yours? My old toes are freezing!&#x2019;&#x201d; And I&#x2019;ll go and find the dragon &#x201d; Where it&#x2019;s playing with my grandchildren &#x201d; And ask it, quite nicely, to come inside and attend to the needs of His Royal Highness, the Prince of Montagne.&#x201d; I giggled; I could not help it. Oh, bosh! You say that to a dragon and it&#x2019;ll gobble me up, as sure as salt&#x2019;s salt.&#x201d; And what would that do to your handsome good looks?&#x201d; I teased him. Improve them, I&#x2019;d wager,&#x201d; he answered with a grin. Now, you be good and drink that wretched concoction, and I&#x2019;ll take you up there next week. Just the two of us.&#x201d; Truly? With a picnic? A big one?&#x201d; Absolutely.&#x201d; He, too, kissed my cheeks, and with a last exaggerated bow in my direction, he clattered down the stairs. Wrapping myself in a quilt, I crept to the window. In the courtyard below, Mother frowned as she struggled to fit her own golden princess circlet, for she had little skill at ceremony. With a flourish of trumpets, Uncle Ferdinand appeared at the great entrance to the castle proper, looking every inch the king in his robes of state. Unlike my father, UUncle Ferdinand truly was handsome, tall and lean and solemn. At his side stepped the group&#x2019;s martial escort, Xavier the Elder, a grizzled warrior who had shaved so thoroughly that several nicks still oozed blood. Queen Sophia appeared as well, displaying the precise gestures and expressions expected of a woman of her rank. A quintet of soldiers played a military hymn, and then Mother, Father, Ferdinand, and Xavier strode across the drawbridge through a double phalanx of saluting guards. Father glanced back to smile a last greeting at me as Mother slipped her arm through his and lay her head on his shoulder. His armor must have been cold, given the unseasonable chill of the day, but the love between them transcended such trivial discomfort. Seeing them off, the queen stood at attention for exactly the amount of time that a queen should, and then with a cool flick of her gown turned back toward the castle, the footmen falling in behind her. Alone at last, the quilt about my shoulders, I sighed as I considered all the tasks that awaited me. A wool vest I had begun for Father the previous autumn lay half-finished, my efforts immobilized by a plethora of dropped stitches. Clearly it would not serve him this winter; at the rate I was progressing, years could pass before the thing warmed him. My mother had delegated to me the task of transcribing her grandmother&#x2019;s yellowed recipes, the goal being to learn the art of cooking while improving my penmanship. Unfortunately the assignment always left me famished, rooting through the kitchen pantries like an autumn bear. Hunger was a burden I could not tolerate for even a heartbeat, a truth that my physique amply demonstrated. Simply glancing at the stack of stained and curling recipes sent my stomach to growling. Outside, the master of hounds returned with his pack, the dogs gleeful and wet from a long run and a swim in the Great River. But even their prancing enthusiasm did not lift my own misery. With only the ubiquitous murmur from the soldiers&#x2019; barracks to comfort me, I crept back into bed, seeking refuge from the oppressive mist that cloaked the castle&#x2019;s turrets. Perusing my shelves, I could not find one volume to satisfy me. The fairy tales I had read countless times. The more recent additions held even less interest: dry histories of Montagne, geometry textbooks, a medical treatise on bloodletting that my mother appeared never to have opened and that she now put to use as a bookend. I squirmed further under the covers. My mind drifted, wondering if the foursome had yet arrived at my grandfather&#x2019;s tomb, what they would say there in his honor. I had practiced my own speech for weeks, and had been quite proud of my little poem praising the Badger&#x2019;s courage, the last stanza in particular: <br><br> You perished to save all of us. I hope your armor never rusts.<br><br>A dramatic conclusion, I believed at the time, though it now occurred to me that any armor entombed with a corpse for thirty-odd years would doubtless experience some corrosion. This realization only deepened my malaise. At last I drifted into a fitful sleep. Though slumber should remove us from the trials of our waking life surely I always settled my head with this expectation, and ere this day had always found satisfaction my present nap did rather the opposite. Almost at once, it seemed, my rest was disturbed by haunting images of the castle corridors. Not my familiar apartment, constructed scarce a century earlier with the new perimeter fortifications, but the castle proper, noble and ancient, with walls as thick as three men, and the Montagne hedgehog, emblem of the kingdom, carved in countless obscure corners. In this dream as I walked the corridors, one of these hedgehogs uncurled itself and turned to stare at me with black, unblinking eyes. Try as I might, I could not escape this piercing glare; I was trapped as utterly as a fish on a hook, though unlike a fish I could not even thrash about, for the paralysis of nightmare held me immobilized. Larger and larger those eyes grew, until their impenetrable blackness filled my vision. I had the sensation, provided by that sporadic omniscience that accompanies dream- state, that I must creep forward, though I had not a notion in the world whereto I was headed, or whether the floor below me would dissolve in abyss. At once a voice, opaque and unidentifiable, filled my ears: It is time.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Man Who Solved the Market: How Jim Simons Launched the Quant Revolution</h2><p><p>Jim Simons is the greatest moneymaker in modern financial history.

Wilson&#x2019;s story does all that, in less than four thousand words.</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s late at night, my darling. And the stars are in the sky. That means it is time for me to give you a kiss. And an Eskimo kiss. And now I will lay you down and tuck you in, nice and tight, so you stay warm all night.&#x201d;</p> <p>This is our mantra. I think of it like the computer code I use to control deep space simulations in the laboratory. You recite the incantation and the desired program executes.</p> <p>I call this one &#x201c;bedtime.&#x201d;</p> <p>Marie holds her stuffed rabbit close, in a chokehold. In the dim light, a garden of blond hair grows over her pillow. She is three years old and smiling and she smells like baby soap. Her eyes are already closed.</p> <p>&#x201c;I love you, honey,&#x201d; I say.</p> <p>As a physicist, it bothers me that I find this acute feeling of love hard to quantify. I am a man who routinely deals in singularities and asymptotes. It seems like I should have the mathematical vocabulary to express these things.</p> <p>Reaching for her covers, I try to tuck Marie in. I stop when I feel her warm hands close on mine. Her brown eyes are black in the shadows.</p> <p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she says, &#x201c;I do it.&#x201d;</p> <p>I smile until it becomes a wince.</p> <p>This version of the bedtime routine is buckling around the edges, disintegrating like a heat shield on reentry. I have grown to love tucking the covers up to my daughter&#x2019;s chin. Feeling her cool damp hair and the reassuring lump of her body, safe in her big-girl bed. Our routine in its current incarnation has lasted one year two months. Now it must change. Again.</p> <p>I hate change.</p> <p>&#x201c;OK,&#x201d; I murmur. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a big girl. You can do it.&#x201d;</p> <p>Clumsily and with both hands, she yanks the covers toward her face. She looks determined. Proud to take over this task and exert her independence. Her behavior is consistent with normal child development according to the books I checked out from the library. Yet I cannot help but notice that this independence is a harbinger of constant unsettling, saddening change.</p> <p>My baby is growing up.</p> <p>In the last year, her body weight has increased sixteen percent. Her average sentence length has increased from seven to ten words. She has memorized the planets, the primary constellations, and the colors of the visible spectrum. Red orange yellow green blue indigo violet. These small achievements indicate that my daughter is advanced for her age, but she isn&#x2019;t out of the record books or into child genius territory. She&#x2019;s just a pretty smart kid, which doesn&#x2019;t surprise me. Intelligence is highly heritable.</p> <p>&#x201c;I saw a shooting star,&#x201d; she says.</p> <p>&#x201c;Really? What&#x2019;s it made of?&#x201d; I ask.</p> <p>&#x201c;Rocks,&#x201d; she says.</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. Make a wish, lucky girl,&#x201d; I reply, walking to the door.</p> <p>I pause as long as I can. In the semidarkness, a stuffed bear is looking at me from a shelf. It is a papa teddy bear hugging its baby. His arms are stitched around the baby&#x2019;s shoulders. He will never have to let go.</p> <p>&#x201c;Sweet dreams,&#x201d; I say.</p> <p>&#x201c;Good night, Daddy,&#x201d; she says and I close the door.</p> <p>The stars really are in Marie&#x2019;s bedroom.</p> <p>Two years ago I purchased the most complex and accurate home planetarium system available. There were no American models. This one came from a Japanese company and it had to be shipped here to Austin, Texas, by special order. I also purchased an international power adapter plug, a Japanese-to-English translation book, and a guide to the major constellations.</p> <p>I had a plan.</p> <p>Soon after the planetarium arrived, I installed it in my bedroom. Translating the Japanese instruction booklet as best I could, I calibrated the dedicated shooting star laser, inserted the disc that held a pattern for the Northern Hemisphere, and updated the current time and season. When I was finished, I went into the living room and tapped my then-wife on the shoulder.</p> <p>Our anniversary.</p> <p>My goal was to create a scenario in which we could gaze at the stars together every night before we went to sleep. I am interested in astrophysics. She was interested in romantic gestures. It was my hypothesis that sleeping under the faux stars would satisfy both constraints.</p> <p>Unfortunately, I failed to recall that I wear glasses and that my then-wife wore contact lenses. For the next week, we spent our evenings blinking up at a fuzzy Gaussian shotgun-spray of the Milky Way on our bedroom ceiling. Then she found the receipt for the purchase and became angry. I was ordered to return the planetarium and told that she would rather have had a new car.</p> <p>That didn&#x2019;t seem romantic to me, but then again I&#x2019;m not a domain expert.</p> <p>My thin translation book did not grant me the verbal fluency necessary to negotiate a return of the product to Japan. In response, my then-wife told me to sell it on the Internet or whatever. I chose to invoke the &#x201c;whatever&#x201d; clause. I wrapped the planetarium carefully in its original packaging and put it into the trunk of my car. After that, I stored it in the equipment room of my laboratory at work.</p> <p>Three months later, my then-wife informed me that she was leaving. She had found a job in Dallas and would try to visit Marie on the weekends but no promises. I immediately realized that this news would require massive life recalibrations. This was upsetting. I told her as such and my then-wife said that I had the emotional capacity of a robot. I decided that the observation was not a compliment. However, I did not question how my being a robot might affect my ability to parent a one-and-a-half-year-old. Contrary to her accusation, my cheeks were stinging with a sudden cold fear at the thought of losing my daughter. My then-wife must have seen the question in the surface tension of my face, because she answered it anyway.</p> <p>She said that what I lacked in emotion, I made up for in structure. She said that I was a terrible husband, but a good father.</p> <p>Then-wife kissed Marie on the head and left me standing in the driveway with my daughter in my arms. Marie did not cry when her mother left because she lacked the cognitive capacity to comprehend what had happened. If she had known, I think she would have been upset. Instead, my baby only grinned as her mother drove away. And because Marie was in such good spirits, I slid her into her car seat and drove us both to my laboratory. Against all regulations, I brought her into my work space. I dug through the equipment stores until I found the forbidden item.</p> <p>That night, I gave my daughter the stars.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>The cafeteria where I work plays the news during lunch. The television is muted but I watch it anyway. My plastic fork is halfway to my mouth when I see the eyewitness video accompanying the latest breaking news story. After that, I am not very aware of what is happening except that I am running.</p> <p>I don&#x2019;t do that very much. Run.</p> <p>In some professions, you can be called into action in an emergency. A vacationing doctor treats the victim of an accident. An off-duty pilot heads up to the cockpit to land the plane. I am not in one of those professions. I spend my days crafting supercomputer simulations so that we can understand astronomical phenomena that happened billions of years ago. That&#x2019;s why I am running alone. There are perhaps a dozen people in the world who could comprehend the images I have just seen on the television&#x2014;my colleagues, fellow astrophysicists at research institutions scattered around the globe.</p> <p>I hope they find their families in time.</p> <p>The television caption said that an unexplained astronomical event has occurred. I know better than that. I am running hard because of it, my voice making a whimpering sound in the back of my throat. I scramble into my car and grip the hot steering wheel and press the accelerator to the floor. The rest of the city is still behaving normally as I weave through traffic. That won&#x2019;t last for long, but I&#x2019;m thankful to have these few moments to slip away home.</p> <p>My daughter will need me.</p> <p>There is a nanny who watches Marie during the day. The nanny has brown hair and she is five feet four inches tall. She does not have a scientific mind-set but she is an artist in her spare time. When Marie was ten months old and had memorized all of her body parts (including the phalanges), I became excited about the possibilities. I gave the nanny a sheet of facts that I had compiled about the states of matter for Marie to memorize. I intentionally left off the quark-gluon plasma state and Bose-Einstein condensate and neutron-degenerate matter because I wanted to save the fun stuff for later. After three days I found the sheet of paper in the recycling bin.</p> <p>I was a little upset.</p> <p>Perez in the cubicle next to me said that the nanny had done me a favor. He said Marie has plenty of time to learn about those things. She needs to dream and imagine and, I don&#x2019;t know, finger paint. It is probably sound advice. Then again, Perez&#x2019;s son is five years old and at the department picnic the boy could not tell me how many miles it is to the troposphere. And he says he wants to be an astronaut. Good luck, kid.</p> <p>Oh, yes. Running.</p> <p>My brain required four hundred milliseconds to process the visual information coming from the cafeteria television. Eighty milliseconds for my nervous system to respond to the command to move. It is a two-minute sprint to the parking lot. Then an eight-minute drive to reach home. Whatever happens will occur in the next thirty minutes and so there is no use in warning the others.</p> <p>Here is what happened.</p> <p>An hour and thirty-eight minutes ago, the sky blushed red as an anomaly streaked over the Gulf of Mexico. Bystanders described it as a smear of sky and clouds, a kind of glowing reddish blur. NASA reported that it perturbed the orbital paths of all artificial satellites, including the International Space Station. It triggered tsunamis along the equator and dragged a plume of atmosphere a thousand miles into the vacuum of space. The air dispersed in low pressure but trace amounts of water vapor froze into ice droplets. On the southern horizon, I can now see a fading river of diamonds stretching into space. I don&#x2019;t see the moon in the sky but that doesn&#x2019;t mean it isn&#x2019;t there. Necessarily.</p> <p>All of this happened within the space of thirty seconds.</p> <p>This is not an unexplained astronomical event. The anomaly had no dust trail, was not radar-detectable, and it caused a tsunami.</p> <p>Oh, and it turned the sky red.</p> <p>Light does funny things in extreme gravity situations. When a high-mass object approaches, every photon of light that reaches our eyes must claw its way out of a powerful gravity well. Light travels at a constant speed, so instead of slowing down, the photon sacrifices energy. Its wavelength drops down the visible spectrum: violet indigo blue green yellow orange red.</p> <p>Redshifting.</p> <p>I am running because only one thing could redshift our sky that much and leave us alive to wonder why our mobile phones don&#x2019;t work. What passed by has to have been a previously theoretical class of black hole with a relatively small planet-sized mass&#x2014;compressed into a singularity potentially as small as a pinprick. Some postulate that these entities are starving black holes that have crossed intergalactic space and shrunk over the billions of years with nothing to feed on. Another theory, possibly complementary, is that they are random crumbs tossed away during the violence of the big bang.</p> <p>Perez in the next cubicle said I should call them &#x201c;black marbles,&#x201d; which is inaccurate on several fronts. In my papers, I chose instead to call them pinprick-size black holes. Although Perez and I disagreed on the issue of nomenclature, our research efforts brought consensus on one calculation: that the phenomenon would always travel in clusters.</p> <p>Where there is one, more will follow.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Tornado sirens begin to wail as I careen through my suburban neighborhood. The woman on the radio just frantically reported that something has happened to Mars. The planet&#x2019;s crust is shattered. Astronomers are describing a large part of the planet&#x2019;s mass as simply missing. What&#x2019;s left behind is a cloud of expanding dirt and rapidly cooling magma, slowly drifting out of orbit and spreading into an elliptical arc.</p> <p>She doesn&#x2019;t say it out loud, but it&#x2019;s dawning on her: we are next.</p> <p>People are standing in their yards now, on the sidewalks and grass, eyes aimed upward. The sky is darkening. The wind outside the car window is whispering to itself as it gathers occasionally into a thin, reedy scream. A tidal pull of extreme gravity must be doing odd things to our weather patterns. If I had a pen and paper, I could probably work it out.</p> <p>I slam on the brakes in my driveway to avoid hitting the nanny.</p> <p>She is standing barefoot, holding a half-empty sippy cup of milk. Chin pointed at the sky. Stepping out of the car, I see my first pinprick-size black hole. It is a reddish dot about half the intensity of the sun, wrapped in a halo of glowing, superheated air. It isn&#x2019;t visibly moving so I can&#x2019;t estimate its trajectory. On the southern horizon, the crystallized plume of atmosphere caused by the near-miss still dissipates.</p> <p>It really is beautiful.</p> <p>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; asks the nanny.</p> <p>&#x201c;Physics,&#x201d; I say, going around the car and opening my trunk. &#x201c;You should go home immediately.&#x201d;</p> <p>I pull out a pair of old jumper cables and stride across the driveway. Marie is standing just inside the house, her face a pale flash behind the glass storm door. Inside, I lift my daughter off the ground. She wraps her legs around my hip and now I am running again, toys crunching under my feet, my daughter&#x2019;s long hair tickling my forearm. The nanny has put it into a braid. I never learned how to do that. Depending on the trajectory of the incoming mass, I may not ever have the chance.</p> <p>&#x201c;What did you do today?&#x201d; I ask Marie.</p> <p>&#x201c;Played,&#x201d; she says.</p> <p>Trying not to pant, I crack open a few windows in the house. Air pressure fluctuations are a certainty. I hope that we only have to worry about broken glass. There is no basement to hide in here, just a cookie-cutter house built on a flat slab of concrete. But the sewer main is embedded deep into the foundation. In the worst case, it will be the last thing to go.</p> <p>I head to the bathroom.</p> <p>&#x201c;Wait here for just a second,&#x201d; I say, setting Marie down in the hallway. Stepping into the small bathroom, I wind up and violently kick the wall behind the toilet until the drywall collapses. Dropping to my knees, I claw out chunks of the drywall until I have exposed the main sewer line that runs behind the toilet. It is a solid steel pipe maybe six inches in diameter. With shaking hands, I shove the jumper cable around it. Then I wedge myself between the toilet and the outside wall and I sit down on the cold tile floor, the jumper cables under my armpits anchoring me to the ground. This is the safest place that I can find.</p> <p>If the black hole falling toward us misses the planet, even by a few thousand miles, we may survive. If it&#x2019;s a direct hit, we&#x2019;ll share the fate of Mars. At the sonic horizon, sound won&#x2019;t be able to escape from it. At the event horizon, neither will light.

She eagerly springs to the aid of Sam and Jen as they undertake various household tasks, but only seems to cause trouble despite her well-intentioned efforts. The pages have a few spare lines of text to the left of the double-page spreads, and readers must lift the flap to the far right in order to view the rest of the action. Similar to Josse Goffin's Oh! (Abrams, 1991), the hidden illustrations show the results of Jo's interference, along with the repetitive refrain of "No no, Jo!" The final panel shows the children searching for the missing cat, who is napping under a blanket on the sofa. Sunny, soft-shaded hues add warmth and realism. The mischievous, scrawny feline is full of personality; she fares better than the flatly rendered children.

But there is a bitter rivalry between the priests of Apollo and those of Hecate, who guard the oracle, and when the priests are all killed, the countryside looks to explode in violence as Greeks, Romans, and native Italians of several conquered nations bring out old enmities.</p><p>This riveting historical series began with the Edgar Award&#x2013;nominated <i>SPQR I: The King's Gambit</i> and has gone on to international success in thirteen languages.</p></p><p><p><b>John Maddox Roberts</b> is the author of numerous works of science fiction and fantasy in addition to his SPQR series set in Ancient Rome. He and his wife live in New Mexico.</p>Civil war looms between the forces of Julius Caesar and Pompey, providing an ominous background for Roberts's compelling 12th Roman historical to feature Decius Caecilius Metellus (after 2007's <i>SPQR XI: Under Vesuvius</i>). Recently raised to the post of <i>praetor peregrinus</i>, Metellus is enjoying traveling outside Rome hearing cases involving foreigners, but he gets an unexpected shock at the Oracle of the Dead near the southern Italian town of Baiae. The corpse of Eugaeon, a priest of Apollo, surfaces in the rushing stream of water inside the oracle's temple. Oddly, Eugaeon's body shows no sign of violence but is completely hairless. After the priest's missing colleagues, initially the prime suspects, also turn up dead, the astute sleuth comes to believe that these current killings are but the latest of many. Metellus puts his own life at risk in an exciting case that engages the attention of Pompey himself. <i>(Dec.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The #1 New York Times bestselling author of Morning Star returns to the Red Rising universe with the thrilling sequel to Iron Gold. For a decade Darrow led a revolution against the corrupt color-coded Society. Now, outlawed by the very Republic he founded, he wages a rogue war on Mercury in hopes that he can still salvage the dream of Eo. But as he leaves death and destruction in his wake, is he still the hero who broke the chains? Or will another legend rise to take his place? Lysander au Lune, the heir in exile, has returned to the Core. Determined to bring peace back to mankind at the edge of his sword, he must overcome or unite the treacherous Gold families of the Core and face down Darrow over the skies of war-torn Mercury. But theirs are not the only fates hanging in the balance. On Luna, Mustang, Sovereign of the Republic, campaigns to unite the Republic behind her husband. Beset by political and criminal enemies, can she outwit her opponents in time to save him? Once a Red refugee, young Lyria now stands accused of treason, and her only hope is a desperate escape with unlikely new allies. Abducted by a new threat to the Republic, Pax and Electra, the children of Darrow and Sevro, must trust in Ephraim, a thief, for their salvation--and Ephraim must look to them for his chance at redemption. As alliances shift, break, and re-form--and power is seized, lost, and reclaimed--every player is at risk in a game of conquest that could turn the Rising into a new Dark Age.</p><p></p><h2>In Search of the Dark Ages</h2><p>Focusing on Great Britain, this study of the centuries following the Roman Empire&#39;s demise discusses new archaeological discoveries and, based on these discoveries, reconstructs significant events and personalities of the Dark Ages.</p><p>Reflecting the style of his PBS-TV In Search Of series (but without a television tie-in), Wood's carefully researched foray into early medieval Britain sifts a number of unresolved mysteries. Among them are the questions: Does archeological evidence support the theory that the real King Arthur was a British resistance hero who fought Germanic tribes around 540 A.D.? Is the Sutton Hoo grave in East Anglia the burial site of a dead king? What motivated warrior queen Boadicea to poison herself when the Romans crushed the uprising she led? Wood writes with grace and conversational verve as he incorporates the latest findings. He humanizes some of the most uninspiring or obscure figures in British history, including Ethelred the Unready; Eric Bloodaxe, ruler of Viking York; Anglo-Saxon imperialist king Offa, who staged a coup d'etat; and Alfred the Great, pioneer of town planning.

He was a rural school teacher from Vermont, primarily self-educated, who enlisted in the Union Army simply because he believed he would regret it later if he didn&#39;t. Unlike professional war correspondents, Private Fisk had no access to rank or headquarters. Instead, he wrote of life as a private-as one of the foot soldiers who slept in the mud and obeyed orders no matter how incomprehensible. &#34;As for the plans our superiors are laying out for us to execute,&#34; he wrote, &#34;we know as little as a horse knows of his driver.&#34; Between December 11, 1861 and July 26, 1865, Fisk wrote nearly 100 letters from the battlefield to the Green Mountain Freeman, all of them signed &#34;Anti-Rebel.&#34; At the beginning of the war he was exuberant and eager for contact with the enemy. In his first letter he boasted, &#34;This regiment would relish a fight now extremely well.&#34; Two years later, after the battle of Gettysburg, Fisk was disillusioned and war weary. &#34;The rebel dead and ours lay thickly together, their thirst for blood forever quenched. Their bodies were swollen, black, and hideously unnatural. Their eyes glared from their sockets, their tongues protruded from their mouths, and in almost every case, clots of blood and mangled flesh showed how they had died, and rendered a sight ghastly beyond description. I thought I had become hardened to almost anything, but I cannot say I ever wish to see another sight like that I saw on the battle-field of Gettysburg.&#34; Fisk wrote as eloquently on the moral and political issues behind the war as he did on the everyday hardships of life in the Army of the Potomac. He saw the war as a question of right and wrong-of freedom against slavery and democracy against aristocracy-and he continued to believe that the war had to be fought, even after he was well acquainted with its horror and pointlessness. &#34;When they have done their killing, there remains the question to be settled the same as before. They might as well have settled it before the shooting as afterwards.&#34; In this volume editors Ruth and Emil Rosenblatt have included all of Fisk&#39;s existing letters to the Freeman, along with three speeches from the 1890s in which Fisk looks back on his wartime experiences from the vantage point of an older man. &#34;This is one of the richest collections of Civil War letters I have seen. I doubt if I have seen any collection that surpasses it. Fisk is intelligent and thoughtful. He writes well and the prose is still accessible to a late twentieth-century reader. He successfully presents the minutiae of soldier life-marching, food, picketing, pay, battles-while also explicating the issues behind the war.&#34;-Reid Mitchell, author of Civil War Soldiers: Their Expectations and Experiences. &#34;Fisk&#39;s letters are marvelous. It is almost unbelievable, they are such literary gems. In fact, they are so good that the thought occurred to me that perhaps they are not authentic. It would be believable that some expert novelist had created them!&#34;-Herman Hattaway, coauthor of How the North Won the Civil War and Why the South Lost the Civil War. &#34;An important combat chronology of the war from the infantry private&#39;s viewpoint.&#34;-James McPherson, author of Battle Cry of Freedom. &#34;The letters contain descriptions of conditions in camp, on the march, and in hospitals; comments on battles, officers, and army morale; reactions to places seen and executions of deserters, as well as Fisk&#39;s political views and military frustrations.&#34;-Choice. &#34;The Fisk letters are superb. They are extremely well written and they convey a magnificent picture of the life of a Federal soldier in the Army of the Potomac.&#34;-Civil War Book Exchange.</p><p>"One of the finest records I know of what it was like to fight and win the Civil War."--Geoffrey C.

Though they are used to tending the sick, nothing could have prepared them for what they confront, first on a hospital ship near Gallipoli, then on the Western Front. <br> <br>Yet amid the carnage, the sisters become the friends they never were at home and find them�selves courageous in the face of extreme danger and also the hostility from some on their own side. There is great bravery, humor, and compassion, too, and the inspiring example of the remarkable women they serve alongside. In France, where Naomi nurses in a hospital set up by the eccen�tric Lady Tarlton while Sally works in a casualty clearing station, each meets an exceptional man: the kind of men for whom they might give up some of their newfound independence&#x2014;if only they all survive. <br> <br>At once vast in scope and extraordinarily intimate, <i>The Daughters of Mars</i> brings World War I vividly to life from an uncommon perspec�tive. Thomas Keneally has written a remarkable novel about suffering and transcendence, despair and triumph, and the simple acts of decency that make us human even in a world gone mad.</p><p>Thomas Keneally began his writing career in 1964 and has published thirty-three novels since, most recently <i>Crimes of the Father</i>, <i>Napoleon&#x2019;s Last Island</i>, <i>Shame and the Captives,</i> and the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling <i>The Daughters of Mars</i>. His novels include <i>Schindler&#x2019;s List</i>, which won the Booker Prize in 1982, <i>The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith</i>, <i>Gossip from the Forest</i>, and <i>Confederates</i>, all of which were shortlisted for the Booker Prize. He has also written several works of nonfiction, including his boyhood memoir <i>Homebush Boy</i>, <i>The Commonwealth of Thieves</i>, and <i>Searching for Schindler</i>. He is married with two daughters and lives in Sydney, Australia.The Daughters of Mars Murdering Mrs. Durance<p></p> <br>It was said around the valley that the two Durance girls went off but just the one bothered to come back. People could not have said which one, since both the girls were aloof and looked similar&#x2014;dark and rather tall. There was confusion even in the local paper. And they weren&#x2019;t the sort of girls whose names were called across streets&#x2014;girlfriend hallooing girlfriend in the excitement of Kempsey&#x2019;s big shopping days. Before the war it was the younger one&#x2014;wasn&#x2019;t it?&#x2014;who stayed at home with her parents. The slightly shorter one, anyhow. And it was she who took her mother, Mrs. Durance, to visit the surgeon in Sydney. But what could those Macquarie Street doctors do?<br> <br>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�<br> <br>After a choppy night&#x2019;s passage down the coast aboard the Currawong, Mrs. Durance finally fell asleep off Broken Bay, only to be woken, as the steamer entered the Sydney Heads, by a steward bearing tea&#x2014;Sally being on deck at the time for the experience of the approach to Port Jackson.<br> <br>Mother and daughter had time for another cup of tea at the wharf in Darling Harbour before Sally took the exhausted Mrs. Durance to the surgeon&#x2019;s rooms in Macquarie Street. After an examination by this eminent man, she was sent from his office to Sydney Hospital for X-rays. Then she and Sally met up with Naomi, the other daughter, the one who was considered a bit flash&#x2014;Macleay District Hospital not good enough for her&#x2014;who&#x2019;d been in Sydney a few years.<br> <br>They went that afternoon for a bang-up tea at Cahill&#x2019;s, while they waited for the expert men who read the body&#x2019;s inner secrets from photographs to discover what was wrong with Mrs. Durance. The sisters knew their mother had understated her pain to them. They knew she was secretive about the scale of her bleeding and the urine coming out of the wrong opening.<br> <br>That night, Naomi put them up in her little flat in Bondi Junction&#x2014;Mama sharing Naomi&#x2019;s bed, Sally on the sofa. They could have all stayed at Mrs. Durance&#x2019;s younger sister Jackie&#x2019;s place at Randwick, but Mrs. Durance didn&#x2019;t want to share news of her health problems with her sister yet. Both Sally and Naomi woke several times to their mother&#x2019;s choked-down groans. But unblunted ambition seemed to declare itself the next morning in the briskness with which Naomi put on her uniform and her scarlet cape to go to her duty at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.<br> <br>There had always been something larger than her beginnings written in Naomi Durance&#x2019;s gestures and her long bones. Her parents knew it. She had left them for the city, but in so far as they were boastful, they boasted of her. Sally worked a mere three miles from home, across the river, at the Macleay District Hospital. Merit in that, no one denied, and loyalty. But it was news of Naomi that made eyes shine on the Durance farm.<br> <br>It was cervical cancer, the surgeon told Mrs. Durance the next morning. There was no option of an operation, for it would be a very long, painful, and dangerous procedure, and could not hope to get all of the proliferating cancer. Surgery was to be recommended chiefly in the early stages, whereas metastasis had already occurred, as the X-rays showed. If she rested well and ate lots of fruit, he said, she could expect to live at least a year. She was a dairy farmer&#x2019;s wife? Well, no more butter churning, he said, and no early morning milking. He would give her a script for pain medicine, he told her. He would also be writing to her doctor in the Macleay so that he could keep her comfortable.<br> <br>You are fortunate to have two daughters who are registered nurses, he told her.<br> <br>I am, she said, glowing with pride but hollowed by pain.<br> <br>She and Sally caught the regular outward journey of the Currawong home the next night. Naomi saw them off at Darling Harbour, in the shadow of those shameful slums of the Rocks. From them bubonic plague had come boiling forth in the girls&#x2019; childhoods and been carried north on the Currawong by a rat nestled in a furniture case. Naomi waited in their small cabin until the last call to go ashore and then stayed on the wharf to wave a futile handkerchief, as if she were part of one of those heartbreaking paintings of emigrant farewell.<br> <br>She&#x2019;s so beautiful, isn&#x2019;t she, Sal? asked Mrs. Durance, leaning on the railing from pain rather than as a gesture of languid seafaring. She has a lot of grace, doesn&#x2019;t she?<br> <br>As they reached on a black tide for Dawes Point, the handkerchief still waved, more luminous than Naomi&#x2019;s face. Bush people did that handkerchief-waving stuff and it gave them away as hayseeds. But worldly Naomi risked that tonight. She had promised she&#x2019;d come up as often as she could and help Sally out. But that she would remain a city woman was not questioned.<br> <br>It was a brisk night, and Mrs. Durance developed a cold on top of all else. She again fell asleep late. Again Sally came on deck at dawn and looked out at the blue surge of the tide breaking on the yellow sand of Trial Bay and making enough water at the river bar to allow the Currawong to enter.<br> <br>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�<br> <br>For six months Mrs. Durance ate her fruit and sat in sumps of sunlight on the veranda. But the cancer owned her by night. Sally still worked the day shift at Macleay District but now slept on call in the same room as her mother, her father having moved to a lean-to at the back of the homestead. Sally was to administer a sixth of a grain of morphine hypodermically when brave and reticent Mrs. Durance confessed, one way or another, to agony. Naomi took her holidays and came home on a visit and gave her sister a break from the regimen. In between, Mr. Durance paid their neighbor Mrs. Sorley&#x2019;s girl to sit with Mrs. Durance by day and was attentive himself. Since Mr. Sorley had been killed by a native cedar&#x2014;which when cut had slipped sidewards rather than forwards&#x2014;the Sorley kids were ever ready for employment.<br> <br>Sally noticed more clearly now that though her father and mother were souls of decency, Eric Durance moved about the bedroom as if he and his wife were acquaintances only. He seemed to fear he might be seen as an intruder. There had always been that distant courtesy between her parents. Sally knew they&#x2019;d infected Naomi and her with it too. It might be one of the reasons Naomi had cleared out&#x2014;in the hope that on a different stage she might have a franker soul.<br> <br>Mrs. Durance suffered so much night pain that she frequently told Sally she was praying to God for death. These were remarkable and dramatic things for her to say and&#x2014;since she had always had contempt for overstatement&#x2014;would be forced out of her only by the fiercest anguish.<br> <br>In the seventh month of it, Naomi came back from Sydney again to sit with her mother by day and share the night watch. The second night she was home, Sally slept in her own room while Naomi took up post in Mrs. Durance&#x2019;s room on the camp cot, a surface of canvas no blanket could soften. Naomi was meant to wake Sally at four so that she could take over, but did not come rapping on her door till near dawn. Naomi was in a dress and boots and her eyes looked smeared after gales of tears.<br> <br>Mama&#x2019;s gone, she said. I&#x2019;m sorry, Mama&#x2019;s gone. I ran over to the Sorleys&#x2019; and asked their boy to ride into town to get Dr. Maddox.<br> <br>Sally stammered with a confused and bitter grief and went to go off at once down the hallway. Naomi took her shoulders and gazed at her, straight into her face. Naomi&#x2019;s eyes seemed full of conspiracy. To Sally she had the eyes of a co-murderer. At that instant their shared mercy and their crime drew them together so utterly that they were no longer city and country nurses but sisters once more of the same womb.<br> <br>You didn&#x2019;t wake me for my shift, said Sally.<br> <br>It wasn&#x2019;t necessary, Naomi asserted, frankly, with her gaze on her. She went before it was time to wake you.<br> <br>Let me see her.<br> <br>I washed her and laid her out.<br> <br>Without me?<br> <br>I wanted you to sleep. I burned her nightdresses and the rags she used and took all the tonics and pounded the bottles to dust. Especially that rhubarb concoction Mrs. Sorley swore by.<br> <br>There was indeed still a taint of smoke in the air.<br> <br>Naomi led her sister by the hand and they walked down the hallway to the plain room they had both been conceived in. Blackbutt walls hemmed in the dim corridors they loved and hated, which seemed to pull Sally closer to home but which had proved to be escape avenues for Naomi.<br> <br>There was her mother&#x2014;gray-faced, prepared, serene&#x2014;the girl she had been at some time visible again in these features delivered of pain.<br> <br>Sally heard herself howl and went to her mother&#x2019;s body, kissing the face. The skin of the dead yielded differently. They were beyond pain but past affection too. She kissed the hand. It smelled of the scented soap Naomi had washed the corpse with. This too was proof of death. The living mother smelled of workaday Sunlight soap.<br> <br>Sally found herself on her knees, still caressing the hand, Naomi standing behind and above her. Naomi, who always presumed to do things first. Sally did not know whether to hate her, to attack her eyes, or fall flat in gratitude and wonder. Standing with a purpose in mind, she noticed the hypodermic needle, the morphine solution they had made up of pills actually prescribed by Dr. Maddox, and the unused bottled tablets in case the old doctor wanted to inspect them or return them to stock.<br> <br>She went to the dresser, was poleaxed with loss by the mother-of-pearl hairbrush with strands of her mother&#x2019;s hair in it. She knew the little drawer where her mother kept her subdued pink lipstick and her beige face powder.<br> <br>Yes, said Naomi, you should put some color on her poor face.<br> <br>It was a prayer&#x2014;not an order&#x2014;and Sally set to.<br> <br>The stolen reserve of morphine she had put together to finish her mother had been in the towel and linen cupboard in the hallway. How had Naomi found it? You could bet the solution Naomi had made up and injected for mercy&#x2019;s sake had been poured out, and the spare illicit tablets Sally had filched from Macleay District consigned to fire with the rhubarb tonic. To Sally&#x2014;putting rouge and color into her mother&#x2019;s cheeks&#x2014;it seemed knowledge grew between Naomi and her without them looking at each other. Yesterday they had been near strangers. Now they were altered. A different kind of reserve was imposed on them, and a different intimacy.<br> <br>Is Papa up? Sally asked. Does he know?<br> <br>Not yet. I was frightened. Will we tell him in a moment? Perhaps let the poor fellow rest a few more minutes.<br> <br>For he would need to do the milking even on the morning of his wife&#x2019;s death.<br> <br>But she finds it hard to face him, Sally perceived. Naomi&#x2014;who had tried to avoid the weight of home and its taint of illness&#x2014;had certainly assumed the weight now. She&#x2019;d taken up station on the far side of the bed, across from where Sally, on her knees, put reasonable Methodist coloration on the poor, released features.<br> <br>Naomi said, I didn&#x2019;t have any idea till I came home that it was as bad as that. Her pain was the whole world to her. She could see nothing but it. Well, not any longer.<br> <br>Sally was engrossed with her mother.<br> <br>It was easy, Mama, to steal what you needed. I cut out two pages from the drugs record book. Former nurses who had managed the drugs register had done similar excisions because they did not approve of some missed or untidily written entry. Then for your dear sake I copied the dosages on fresh pages, adding an extra dose of an eighth of a grain of morphine in this case and that, until I&#x2019;d created a phantom two grains, which I then fetched from the drugs cabinet and brought home to you. It&#x2019;s unlikely a doctor or matron will remember a specific dose as months go by. But I don&#x2019;t care if they do.<br> <br>She had kept the tablets hidden behind the bed linen in the hallway dresser. These two grains when mixed in solution and injected would bear away disease and the fuss of enduring all useless treatment. They would reach deep into the body and halt the mechanism of agony. And had now.<br> <br>She kissed her mother&#x2019;s brow before gracing it with the powder. Eric Durance would be astonished by his wife&#x2019;s beauty in death.<br> <br>Naomi declared, I gave her half a grain and we kissed and held hands, though I had to be careful&#x2014;a touch would break her bones. Then she went.<br> <br>You were standing over her? said Sally.<br> <br>They both knew how rare it was that a patient expired while the nurse was standing there to observe and hold a hand. The dead went almost secretively.<br> <br>By good fortune, said Naomi without flinching but without bothering to look at her sister. By good fortune I was there.<br> <br>Again, Sally&#x2019;s astonishment that Naomi had done the right, fierce, loving, and hard thing Sally had meant to do! Even in this she was not to be outshone, the half-mad Sally thought. But Naomi was there because she had found the secret cache and took the burden of soothing her mother&#x2019;s breath down to nothing. A solemn loss and rejoicing were the day&#x2019;s order&#x2014;Mama&#x2019;s freedom now from a world she had never since their babyhoods seemed accustomed to. As for her children, they must now get accustomed to something new. To new love and new hate and mutual shame.<br> <br>The roads being firm just then, Dr. Maddox arrived by motor at midmorning. The town&#x2014;ignorant of medicine&#x2014;loved him for his kindliness and punctuality and a lack of airs in a place where a doctor could easily play the grand wizard. But the hospital staff knew he was one of those tosspots who could carry it off well; that some unforgettable and disabling past event drove him to it. Though he performed surgery only when the other town doctors were not available, he was still a better surgeon when sober than most country doctors. It was peripheral things he was negligent at&#x2014;paperwork, including death certificates. His method with the town at large was to hide it all behind an air of universal brotherhood and to breathe an impeccably mentholated breath over the sickbeds of the shire.<br> <br>That Saturday morning Dr. Maddox came to lower his face over Mrs. Durance and to ask Naomi about the last injection and how many grains, and to accept what she said and then breathe, Good woman&#x2014;good, poor woman. Then he prepared a medical certificate, which he showed Naomi and Sally and which said Mrs. Durance had died of cancer, nephritis, and exinanition. There were in the valley many people Dr. Maddox had certified as dying of nephritis and exinanition. Nephritis and exinanition was the cited verdict all along both banks of the river and inland to the blue, wooded hills where the timber workers camped and always died of nephritis and exinanition, unless a tree fell on them. Farmers who had taken poison to escape the bank had their death certificates compassionately marked by Maddox with that saving formula.<br> <br>This morning of the death, over tea Sally made while keeping her eyes from straying to Naomi, Dr. Maddox sat at the kitchen table and spoke for a while to the girls&#x2019; father. These were very much men&#x2019;s mutterings, half-embarrassed and platitudinous. Their father wore large, mute features, the same he brought to his labors. They had not yet crumbled in grief but somehow promised soon to do so.<br> <br>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�<br> <br>Sally had less reason to stay in the Macleay Valley now. She was maybe a year beyond the age girls left home for marriage. Her sister had returned to her Sydney duties. Mr. Durance took sturdily to his work and employed the Sorley boys when needed. But Sally did not yet feel entitled to go. To flee would be obscene. It would be an insult to her mother&#x2019;s spirit. Her sister could escape because escape ...</p><h2>Rose: The Life and Times of Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy</h2><p>Featuring many anecdotes from the fascinating and colorful life of the Kennedy Clan matriarch, Rose includes new material about the Kennedy family&#39;s theories of the JFK assassination, much detail about Rose&#39;s stormy relationships with her children and grandchildren, the truth about Joe Kennedy&#39;s &#34;affair&#34; with Gloria Swanson, and more. 16 pages of photos.</p><p></p><h2>Floral Applique: Original Designs and Techniques for Medallion Quilts</h2><p>FROM THE PUBLISHER: &#34;Floral Applique, Original Designs and Techniques for Medallion Quilts&#34; is the book for every quilter and crafter who wants to paint with fabric.

The Cat&#39;s Pajamas depicts 26 idioms, bringing new meaning to familiar sayings and tickling your funny bone with a surreal illustration on each page. To ensure you get the hang of it, each expression is used in a sentence and explained at the back of the book. And if you look closely you&#39;ll discover a cat hidden in every painting; some cats are a piece of cake to find, others may require you to use your noodle. A gorgeously illustrated eye-spy book and a unique introduction to idioms, this book is truly the cat&#39;s meow.</p><p>Wallace Edwards is a commissioned artist, as well as a freelance illustrator for books and magazines. He lives in Yarker, Ontario, near Kingston.Like Edwards's previous collection of idioms, Monkey Business (2004), this grouping illustrates figures of speech with outlandish sentences that use and (usually) define them, as well as richly worked paintings. In one, a mouse in a party hat walks along a pipe carrying a piece of birthday cake: "Blanche discovered that finding her way home from the party was a piece of cake." The panels, done in watercolor, colored pencil, and gouache, feature an inexhaustible store of surreal fantasies; there's a frog driving a submersible, a crab tying a giraffe's bowtie, and a panda playing a violin with spaghetti ("In order to have dinner music, Andy was forced to use his noodle"). Cats are tucked into each scene, providing even more reason to explore the images in detail. The explanations for each phrase, provided at the end, will be necessary in some cases--a portrait of Inspector Reinhold, a rhino with a fish perched on his horn, doesn't suggest the suspiciousness that comes with smelling "something fishy," and a snail's pace, as it hurtles down a hill, comes across as quite rapid.

You can&#39;t tell by looking at me that my dad is Poseidon, God of the Sea. It&#39;s not easy being a half-blood these days. You mortals can&#39;t even see the monsters we have to fight all the time. So when a game of dodgeball turned into a death match against an ugly gang of cannibal giants, I couldn&#39;t exactly ask my gym teacher for help. And that was just for starters. This is the one where Camp Half Blood is under attack, and unless I get my hands on the Golden Fleece, the whole camp will be invaded by monsters. Big ones. Can Percy survive the treacherous Sea of Monsters and restore order to Half-Blood Hill?</p><p>Rick Riordan is an award-winning mystery writer. For the past fifteen years he has taught at middle schools in the San Francisco Bay area and in Texas. Rick lives in San Antonio, Texas, with his wife and two sons. Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief, the overall winner of the Red House Children&#39;s Book Award, was Rick&#39;s first novel featuring the heroic young demigod.This action-packed book (second in a series) will delight fans of Percy Jackson, the half-blood son of Poseidon, as Percy once again battles mythical monsters in modern-day settings while on his mission to save the tree that guards Camp Half-Blood. Narrator Jesse Berns helps listeners slip right into the oddly engaging world that Riordan creates, in which contemporary teen characters and those from classical mythology intermingle. Berns is so good at accurately portraying teenagers that it's hard to recall he isn't one; Percy's sarcasm and disdainful tones ("Dude?") are just right, though Berns also reveals his ability to become a satyr, cyclops, or guinea pig ("Reep! Reep!") as required. Berns keeps the pace masterfully taut while also allowing listeners time to revel in the book's humor. J.C.G.

We lived in a small green house that you painted every year after the rains. And in that house we made love almost every day and dreamed about all the lands we would see together, and in that house I imagined writing a book about being there with you. The book would be about love. I knew that then. It would be about living deliriously without all the things and people I held dear. I had you and I had the sea and I had the beautiful blue indigo the women wore on the cloths wrapped around their waists. I had fish and I had the taste of you&#x2014;salty, musky amber, after a long day with the men on the boats.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember those days at the end of the world, mpenzi? The long, bumpy ride on the cement truck back from town loaded up with weekly supplies of cassava, cardamom, and tomato? The way I veiled and covered for you? The way you peeled me open each night, unwrapping my sarongs, my brightly colored scarves one at a time before sleeping, as the flame of the white candle we kept by the bed flickered hungrily. The seashells the size of watermelons that tumbled from the sea. Do you remember walking miles into the mouth of the ocean at low tide, our feet burning until we found her wetness again, fell into her cooling waters, and emerged renewed, the white of your teeth meeting the whites of my eyes?</i> &nbsp; Our story, Ad�&#x2019;s and mine, began one day in autumn. It was the kind of day New Englanders boast about, with red and orange leaves fluttering through an impossibly blue sky. I was walking with a friend, Miriam, down College Street, listening to her chatter on about playing pinball at a bar the night before, and the dull sex with her new boyfriend that followed. A cold wind swept in, and I tilted my face toward the sun for a moment&#x2019;s respite, picturing Miriam in bed beneath a boy. I hooked my arm in hers and pulled her close. Why didn&#x2019;t you come to see me, I said, taking in her flushed cheeks and hazel eyes, fighting the urge to kiss her forehead. I should have, she said, laughing. But then we would have slept through breakfast and never made it to the gym, let alone the steam! And then the cavernous limestone gymnasium at the outskirts of campus was upon us, and Miriam took my hand and pulled me up the wide, shallow steps until we were inside, wandering around in the gothic dark.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hushed dampness of the steam room, I reclined on the highest ledge, absolutely still on my towel. Miriam sat on the floor with her legs crossed, turning herself around in slow circles without a towel underneath her, her ample butt cheeks spread and rubbing against the faded green tile. She had huge pale pink nipples and smooth, fleshy thighs covered with hairs that made her legs appear tanned even in winter. She was like the zaftig women in the paintings by Ingres that I was studying in my art-history courses, the voluptuous women with skin like alabaster getting in and out of the bath.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;What about Thailand?&#x201d; Miriam asked, so out of nowhere that I thought she might be delusional. She began twirling faster. &#x201c;What about Koh Samui and Phuket and Chiang Mai?&#x201d; Spinning faster and faster, as if the words themselves were propelling her body.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Mmm, hmm,&#x201d; I said, joining in. &#x201c;What about Egypt? What about Karnak and Abu Simbel and Giza? What about Luxor and Aswan?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Yes!&#x201d; Miriam said excitedly, going even faster now, no doubt chafing her buttocks and the backs of her thighs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;What about the Nile?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was nineteen years old to Miriam&#x2019;s twenty-one. I felt raw and unfinished, where she seemed complete and self-assured. I was a child of divorce and felt like I came from a thousand places&#x2014;each one holding a little piece of me, and I drifted among them with no way to gather them up. Miriam was from just one place, Miami, and more specifically, the moneyed enclave of Coconut Grove.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Yale, she belonged to a set I had not known, even in the progressive environs of my gentrified Haight-Ashbury high school. Miriam and her friends built shrines to Madonna adorned with gold spray-paint and rose petals. They loved red wine and postmodern feminist artists like Cindy Sherman, Jenny Holzer, Frida Kahlo, and the Guerrilla Girls. They quoted Julia Kristeva, Karl Marx, and Simone de Beauvoir. They read Rilke and Thoreau and Whitman and nodded sagely when I brought a battered old copy of poems by Borges and added it to the makeshift library on the mantle of the old house that Miriam and her four closest friends had rented on Howe Street.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I met Miriam in a film-studies class, Power and Politics: The Film of Latin America. We both wept at the end of the Cuban classic <i>Lucia</i>, and from that moment, were one. We found that we were, in some ways, the same&#x2014;outsiders in a world of insiders, and together we limned the depths of normalcy, pushing the sharp edge of the envelope with our tongues. We crashed parties at elitist mausoleums and secret societies that still held the intoxicating perfume of luxury. We spent drunken evenings at Bar, the hangout of morose comp-lit students we loved to mock. We laughed over whiskey sours while they downed vodka and agonized over the anti-Semitism of deconstructionist Paul de Man.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miriam fascinated me, as if she were an exquisite object, a multifaceted ruby, or a one hundred foot tall Buddha. She paired a diamond ring her father gave her with a ripped polyester skirt that we bought at a thrift store for two dollars. She sometimes tied a colorful scarf over her dark brown hair, knotted beneath her chin. She walked with her solid calves turned out slightly, as if she belonged to a village in the Old Country. When the neo-Gothic limestone of our Ivy League grew too much to bear, Miriam picked me up in her dusty red Chevy Nova, complete with pink and orange strands of Mardi Gras beads dangling from her neck, and drove us out of New Haven to Cinema 21, several towns over. Some evenings we watched the sunset from East Rock, a tall bluff outside of town, interlacing our fingers and pressing our cheeks together to keep warm. Miriam was a force. She pursued, adored, and claimed me, and I was desperate to be claimed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day Miriam and I kissed, not because we felt passion for each other, but because we wanted to know what it felt like. We were on a ferry going to visit her mother and decided to try. Our tongues collided as we left Mystic, with all its submarines and tools of war, and the Connecticut coastline trailing behind us. She felt strange and new in my arms, round and soft where boyfriends in the past were tall and solid, moist and yielding where they were firm and sovereign. In that moment, I loved her more than all the rest. She was rooted but unbound. She functioned in the middle of the cacophony. I wanted to devour her and take some of her knowledge for myself.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One night not long after, the girls threw a rather large party, a soir�e, at their house on Howe Street, and after too many bottles of wine and too much Bob Dylan and on the third go-round of Truffaut&#x2019;s <i>The 400 Hundred Blows</i> on the muted television set, I whispered to Miriam a little too loudly that I thought a boy across the room named Parker was cute&#x2014;a little James Dean cum Jackson Pollock, very drunk and very emotionally cut off, and thus, very manly. We were lazing on her huge bed, tucked into an alcove in the living room by then; things were winding down, but many of the guests hung on. I wonder if he can fuck, I said to her as a kind of foreplay, and slowly reached my tongue to meet hers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miriam responded enthusiastically, to my kiss or the promise of Parker I can&#x2019;t be sure, but I accepted it willingly, just the same, with all the frisson of transgression. When we came up for air, the conversation had stopped all around us, and Miriam righted herself on her pillow, then filled the space with a throaty <i>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</i> drawl. &#x201c;Parker, Parker,&#x201d; she called, patting the mattress of her queen-size bed. &#x201c;Come sit here, by us, honey.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a turning point, the first time we ensnared an outsider into our web, the first time we created an us that preyed upon a <i>them</i>, an <i>us</i> that, in loyalty and in every other way that mattered, took precedence over everyone and everything else.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parker strutted over, beer in hand, cowboy boots clacking on the floor, and slid onto the bed alongside Miriam, kicking one leg over her already slightly parted thigh. In response, she ran her hand over his chest, casually unbuttoning his shirt and finding his nipples. He lurched forward and let out a low growl that made my own nipples stand up. Somewhere behind me I heard the tinkle of bottles and the rumblings of the exiting <i>salonistes</i>, but I was riveted by the scene before me, transfixed by what Miriam was creating for my pleasure.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That night we both had Parker, as many times as he would oblige us, and we kissed several times and rubbed each other&#x2019;s back and thighs while Parker labored, reminding the other of the tender softness that was there too. But we never made love with each other, not in the conventional sense. There was no mounting or rubbing, no sharing of bodily fluids, though the intimacy of watching each other was intense. There was a moment so vivid&#x2014;Miriam with her head back, her hands between her legs as Parker entered her&#x2014;it could have been etched into my memory with a machete. She reached out her free hand to find mine, then opened her eyes and smiled at me, bridging for me the endless distance between beholder and beheld.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then we wanted to sleep, and we wanted to do it without Parker. Suddenly he smelled bad and took up far too much room. We woke him up and told him to leave. He was hurt and looked it, even as his hangover bravado provided some cover. He pushed his face into his pillow, feigning exhaustion and mumbling about the cold, but we were unrelenting, verging on cruel. Finally, he pulled his shirt on, and Miriam slid close to me from behind. She draped her arm around my waist and I felt spent, delicious, and shockingly guilt free. &nbsp; At dinner the next night, over a bowl of pasta with mushrooms, Miriam exclaimed that boys could come and go&#x2014;and here she raised her wine glass and leaned toward me, touching her perfect nose to mine. &#x201c;But we,&#x201d; she said with a flourish, &#x201c;we are what remains.&#x201d; &nbsp; Within days, Miriam and I had a plan. We had traveled together before, but this time we would go for a year, maybe two. Within weeks a huge map of Africa was taped on top of the giant Walasse Ting poster of wildflowers hanging on the wall of my tiny off-campus apartment. As we drew lines and calculated distances, I eked out the last major paper of my college career on the poetics of space and the encoding of meaning into the built environment, paragraph by paragraph, citation by citation. There were days I thought I could not write another line, could not figure another way to make one idea tie coherently to the next. The giant map, the huge continent, beckoned, but Africa did not seem real. I could not imagine taming the beast at the computer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then one day, there it was. The end. Miriam and some friends took me out for tapas. I ate olives, little pieces of bread dipped in oil, a salad of tomato and fish. I drank wine, a nice Sancerre. I came back to the apartment afterward, light-headed, and began to pack. I threw hundreds of pages of drafts into a huge black garbage bag and tied it shut. I sat in the middle of the living room, watching the sun come up, as Segovia played classical guitar through the tiny speaker on my windowsill.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miriam came to check on me in the early afternoon. We had rented a storage space on Orange Street, and she had picked up the key. We took our books over, and the chair and ottoman splashed with green flowers of felt I bought for twenty-five dollars at the Salvation Army. My paintings&#x2014;a Mexican girl standing by the window, the Picasso etching my father gave me as a child, a huge disfigured ghost I bought from an art-school student who buried his canvases for months, then dug them up as if reclaiming dead ancestors&#x2014;went too, encased in large cardboard picture boxes. I kept my favorite sweater and unceremoniously dumped the rest of my clothes on the porch of the campus ministry. I was spent and hungry, high on the promise of the unknown. And then we left that place, the cold walls of stone. We were going. We were in flight. We were gone.</p><h2>The Awakened Family: How to Raise Empowered, Resilient, and Conscious Children</h2><p>Become the awakened parent you&#39;ve always wanted to be and watch your children thrive.

In an initial chapter,the author makes a credible case that the ten lost tribes of Israel are really the Jews of Kurdistan and other northern provinces of ancient Persia. Since Babylon was a Persian province for a thousamd years, the Babylonia talmud was really a product of Persia's Jewish community and Persia was the center of Jewish thought for a thousand years. The book also chronicles what life was really like for Jews under Islam and completely undercuts the myth that Jews were protected from persecution, mass murder and forced conversions in Islamic countries. The Jewish experience in Persia is put in the context of general Persian history in each chapter. The role of the clerics in state rule is amply illustrated and makes understandable the current Islamic regime in Iran and why the populace has accepted the rule of the Islamicists. This is an important book for those who want to understand Jewish history and for those who want to know how religious minorities are treated in Islamic countries.<br>tp</p><p></p><h2>Everyone&#39;s Guide to the Hereafter</h2><p>For those who fear death this book will be of immense comfort; for perhaps it is the possible pain of dying that frightens us most.</p><p></p><h2>The Communist Postscript (Pocket Communism)</h2><p>Since Plato, philosophers have dreamed of establishing a rational state ruled through the power of language.

In addition to conventional chemotherapy after her mastectomy, Ireland undertook holistic healing that involved homeopathic treatment, lying on an electromagnetic table and meditation with quartz crystals. With the assistance of these therapies and the support of her family, to whom she pays fulsome tribute, she explored her inner resources. Illness caused a reassessment of values, a scaling down of lifestyle, until she forged an understanding of pain and an ability to face a life-threatening situation. Upbeat and, despite some theatrical hyperbole, inspiring. Photos not seen by PW. First serial to Ladies Home Journal. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.With this book Jill Ireland, actress and wife of actor Charles Bronson, joins the roster of celebrity women including Betty Rollins and Betty Ford who have written books about their experiences as breast cancer patients. Although her treatment consisted principally of the traditional surgery followed by drug treatments, Ireland also sought out a variety of other therapies such as homeopathy and meditation to help her cope with the psychological and emotional effects of the disease and the debilitating reactions to medication. The book chronicles both physical and mental aspects of the recovery, emphasizing the mind-body connection in physical illnesses like cancer in a positive, sometimes humorous style.

This book teaches readers how to make a wide variety of moveable paper puppets, charming toys, and novel, artful gifts. The projects are beautiful, magical, whimsical and will appeal to readers with many different craft interests. There is something very childlike about puppets, yet they are not easily dismissed into something strictly &#x2018;for children&#x2019;. Paper puppets are versatile, easy to make, and can be used with many types of artwork such as on cards or in shadow boxes.</p></p><p><p>Norma Toraya, aka Crankbunny, is an animation director for Curious Pictures in NYC where she works on commercials, music videos, TV intros, documentaries, and projections for different clients.

"The Fox, the Hare, and the Cock" and "The Girl and the Geese" are cumulative stories with a traditional European ambiance. Youngsters should enjoy repeating Fox's "'When I clump, ta-ra! When I thump, ta-ra! When I jump, ta-ra-ra! How the fur flies!'" as he tries to scare the other animals away. "Battibeth," which tells of a girl's fantastic search for her mother's carving knife, is offbeat and will appeal to children's sense of the absurd. The selections are short enough to be used with preschoolers and told by beginning storytellers, but they have not been simplified to the point of blandness. It is unfortunate that there are no source notes. The realistic illustrations are crisp, yet they are softly shaded. Messenger uses lush color throughout and pays scrupulous attention to details, down to the nasty face on a jug of sour milk and the gradations of colors of the elegant cockerel. Each page's handsome design and layout draw readers into the book, and the variations in type style and size create visual interest.<br><i>Cheri Estes, Dorchester Road Regional Library, Charleston, SC</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.One of Britain's finest novelists for young people (The Owl Service, 1967), who's long been interested in folklore (A Bag of Moonshine, 1986), creates three nursery tales distinguished by a folkloric lilt and his own fresh imagery. In the cumulative ``The Fox, the Hare, and the Cock,'' Fox moves into Hare's hut of bark when his own ice hut melts, and is finally driven out by clever Cock after larger, stronger animals have failed. ``The Girl and the Geese'' concerns a child who saves her little brother from geese who've carried him off, but only after she tastes a ``sharp apple,'' ``sour milk,'' and ``sad pies'' offered by prospective helpers (a tree, a brook). And the dreamlike adventure of ``Battibeth'' begins with an errand to her grandmother to trade an egg for a knife; along the way, she loses the egg but finds a needle, which is transformed into a steeple that she climbs for an empowering view (and there's still more in this imaginative, powerfully symbolic sequence). Compact and intriguingly mysterious; handsomely illustrated with precisely detailed images, deployed effectively against dramatic white.

This is a figurative way of saying &#34;not balanced&#34;. The cake is burned on the one side, uncooked on the other; on one side it is overdone, on the other, totally undone. The cake is unfit to be eaten and is thus destined to be cast out. Our God is most balanced. He is love and He is light. Our Lord Jesus is full of grace and full of truth. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of wisdom as well as of revelation. In creation, God &#34;hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with a span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and the hills in a balance&#34; (Is. 40.12). Concerning redemption, it is said that &#34;mercy and truth are met together, righteousness and peace have kissed each other. Truth springeth out of the earth; and righteousness hath looked down from heaven&#34; (Ps. 85.10,11). The new creation, therefore, must be well balanced. In this present volume, Watchman Nee attempts to show from God&#39;s word the perfect equilibrium of divine truth. Human nature, however, is prone to emphasize one side to the exclusion of the other side of truth. This has caused much confusion and many problems among God&#39;s people. It is essential that we know the balance of truth and hold on to both sides so that our Christian life may be well rounded as God has ordained. The contents of the book opens with a treatment of the balance between the gate and the way; continues with a presentation of the balance between the objective and the subjective; includes a discussion on the work inward and the work outward in the Christian life, as well as on the rest given and the rest found as promised by Christ; contemplates the other side of prayer frequently neglected, namely, to watch; and concentrates on the other less emphasized aspect of the trespass-offering, that of restoration. The book then provides a commentary on the contrast between the truly meek and the spiritually poor, and finally concludes with a consideration of the equilibrium that is so necessary between the believer&#39;s faith and the believer&#39;s walk. May all who read this volume be brought into a balanced Christian life.</p><p></p><h2>Making Fabulous Pincushions: 93 Designs For Spectacular &amp; Unusual Projects</h2><p>"...an absolute wealth of creative ways to stick it': an old shoe covered with antique laces...a birdhouse cage for gathering together sewing materials; and a rose wristband....Truly decorative accessories that might prompt the coinage of a new phrase, pretty as a pincushion.'"--Booklist. 144 pages (all in color), 8 1/2 x 11. <br></p><p>More than just places to store sharp sewing objects, the pincushions detailed here also include sewing organizers, needle keepers, and the like. The general instructions up front are a bit disorganized, skipping from specific stitch directions (e.g., how to complete a bullion petal stitch) to lamination. In addition, many of the 93 projects demand more than stitchery skills; clay sculpturing and woodworking are also incorporated into some of the patterns. Minor flaws aside, Packham presents an absolute wealth of creative ways to "stick it" : an old shoe covered with antique laces and exquisite fabrics and stuffed; cushions formed in the shape of fruits and animals (e.g., rabbit, turtle); a birdhouse cage for gathering together sewing materials; and a rose wristband for traveling sewers. Truly decorative accessories that might prompt the coinage of a new phrase, "pretty as a pincushion." <i>Barbara Jacobs</i></p><h2>The Mysterious Governess (Signet Regency Romance)</h2><p>Mr. Darnell Somerton, one of London&#39;s most eligible bachelors, is puzzled and intrigued by Miss Harriet Tremaine, a young governess who inexplicably rejects him</p><p></p><h2>Find Me</h2><p><p><b>In this spellbinding new exploration of the varieties of love, the author of<i> Call Me by Your Name</i> lets us back into his characters' lives years after their first meeting</b></p><p>In <i>Find Me</i>, Aciman shows us Elio's father, Samuel, on a trip from Florence to Rome to visit Elio, now a gifted classical pianist.

It was derived from, and replaced the M1 Garand of World War II and Korean War fame. It in turn was replaced by the 5.56 mm M16 in the early stages of the War in Vietnam. Although the M14 lasted less then 10 years as the military service rifle, its effect was overwhelming in civilian and military match target shooting for thirty year, especially at ranges exceeding 600 yards, and in the development of military and paramilitary sniper rifles. <p>The M14-Type Rifles presents both the military and civilian side of this fine rifle along with a complete run-down on non-military clones of the M1A variety. The M14 was built for the U.S. military at the Springfield National Armory, at Winchester Repeating Firearms, Harrington and Richardson and TRW. Civilian versions have been built by a host of companies including Springfield, Inc., Armscorp and others. Very fine receivers for building do-it-yourself match target rifles have been manufactured by, among others, Entr&#x201a;prise Arms, Smith, Armscorp and DPS. Topics covered include a complete examination of parts and means of identification by manufacturer, the development, manufacture and use of the M14, the development of the M21 and M25 sniper rifles and their telescopic sights and mounts which are covered in a separate chapter, and the National Match M14 and M1A target rifles. </p><p>The book provides a history of the development of the civilian version of the M14 and the civilian version, the M1A,by its various manufacturers, including those in both Chinas. A chapter is given over to accurizing the M1A rifle for "do-it-yourselfers and for custom rifle smiths and the U.S. Army's National Match Specifications and building techniques are listed. Ammunition selection and preparation for match shooting and shooting techniques and positions are detailed. The book is heavily illustrated with photographs and line drawings. Also included are a list of manufacturers, parts and accessory suppliers and custom rifle smiths capable of building less than 1 minute of angle rifles. </p><p>In the preparation of this book, manufacturer's of both of complete M1A rifles and of M1A receivers were reviewed and their products tested. Three M14-type rifles were then built by well- known custom rifle smiths. The complete procedures are laid out along with tips and cautions so that the reader so inclined can build his or her own service or target M14-type rifle for competition or target shooting.</p></p><p>The M14-Type Rifles: A Shooters and Collector&#39;s Guide is a book that will satisfy both shooters and collectors. A complete history of the development of the M14 and its civilian counterparts is given. Also a part-by-part discussion of the M14 rifle complete with codes and markings so that each part can be identified. The various commercial rifles are discussed as are those made in China by Norinco and Polytech. Step-by-step procedures for glass-bedding an M14 stock for increased accuracy is given, plus the proper use of commercial, military and match ammunition. A straight forward account of planning a match rifle with a custom gun smith to reduce costs and increase accuracy is provided.</p><h2>Dust Clouds in the Middle East: The Air War for East Africa, Iraq, Syria, Iran and Madagascar, 1940-42</h2><p>Originally appearing as a series of magazine articles, the valuable research into air operations, over the old-style Middle East of World War II, here appears in book form. It deals with a variety of engagements between Britain and her Commonwealth forces and the Germans, Italians and Vichy French across many borders and differing terrains.

He lives in London and Essex with his wife and children.Starred Review. The seemingly inexhaustible Oliver (The Naked Chef, Happy Days with the Naked Chef, etc.) returns with what may be his best book yet. Aiming to educate readers on cooking basics, Oliver offers over 175 recipes that emphasize flavor and freshness over labor-intensive preparation. With a conversational style that favors general guidelines over strict instructions-recipes often call for a "knob of butter," a "handful of shelled peas" or "a big handful of freshly grated Parmesan"-Oliver's friendly and enthusiastic approach handily deflates new cook anxiety. Loaded with photos that cover common skills like cleaning and preparing fresh lobster, discerning degrees of doneness in meat and crafting homemade pasta, Oliver's patient explanations leave little room for confusion. His dishes, many of which are updated versions of classics, are impressive and accessible. A simple baked potato is made savory by stuffing it with bacon, anchovies and sage, and a basic risotto becomes extraordinary with the addition of apples, walnuts and gorgonzola. Empathizing with those strapped for time, he offers four takes on that trusty fall-back, chicken breasts, all of which can be prepared in a single baking dish. Loaded with everyday dishes ranging from fried calamari and onion gratin to shortbread cookies, this volume doesn't set any new culinary standards, but it will certainly make an impact on determined newcomers still intimidated by the prospect of preparing a three course dinner. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

For the next five months&#x2014;April to early September 1849&#x2014;he persevered in writing his remarkably detailed diary, recounting his experiences among the more than thirty thousand goldseekers representing all thirty states who struggled across half of the continent to California&#x2019;s &#x201c;gold fields.&#x201d; With each entry the reader is drawn into the changing circumstances, from a hurried trailside burial of a comrade to a defense against an Indian attack; from suffering thirst in the desert to anger at a lazy campmate.&nbsp;Unlike most diarists who at the end of the epic journey gave up their demanding task, Delano continued his vivid account until the summer of 1851. He went on to report as a professional journalist, ranging far and wide across the scenes of life in the diggings and the cities, from prospecting along the Yuba River to witnessing lynch law in San Francisco.&nbsp;First published in 1854 as <i>Life on the Plains and among the Diggings</i> and deemed a California Gold Rush classic, this new edition will carry on the adventure for thousands of new readers.</p><p>J. S. Holliday is the director emeritus of the California Historical Society and the author of <i>The World Rushed In: The California Gold Rush Experience</i> and <i>Rush for Riches: Gold Fever and the Making of California.</i>&#x201c;Whether or not the reader is as enamored of diaries and memoirs as I, there is so much detail, so much revelation about feelings, opinions, and beliefs of both the author and those he writes about, that this should be required reading in every high school and college reading list. It is a wonderful book.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Roundup Magazine</i> (<i>Roundup Magazine</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This new edition will serve as a fine introduction to the gold rush literature for new readers and as a welcome reminder to established scholars.&#x201d;&#x2014;David A.

Erikson, 1930-1980</h2><p>Covers a wide spectrum of topics on human development from children&#39;s play and the dreams of adults, cross-cultural observations, young adulthood, and the life cycle, to reminiscences about some of Erikson&#39;s colleagues, such as Anna Freud</p><p>In a thick volume that spans 50 years of distinguished work on the part of well-known psychoanalyst Erikson, editor Schlein assembles 47 previously uncollected papers (including many obscure journal articles and 11 unpublished works, 2 recently translated from the German) and 13 drawings Erikson did of children and friends. Organized chronologically according to such topics as children's play, cross-cultural observations of the Sioux and Yurok Indians, and reflections on identiy, the writings (though repetitious and imprecise for the lay reader) show Erikson's interdisciplinary efforts to integrate man's social and cultural context with the ego's lifelong capacity for growth and development.

These pieces were ascribed to a variety of writers - the heteronyms or assumed identities Pessoa had created over the course of his extravagant written life. Attributed to the heteronym Bernado Soares, THE BOOK OF DISQUIET is perhaps best described as an &#39;anti-literature&#39;. Written in exquisite, painful detail, this is a collection of fragments, an &#39;autobiography of one who never lived&#39;. Richard Zenith has drawn on his own intimate knowledge of the original manuscripts to produce a beautiful and captivating translation of one of the greatest works of the twentieth century.</p><p>"Fernando Pessoa is probably the greatest 20th century writer you have never heard of." -- <i>Lindsay Waters, Los Angeles Times, 10 January 1999</i><br><br>"How best to encompass a book quite as strange and fragmented as The Book of Disquiet?" -- <i>Michael Glover, The Independent on Sunday, 20 May 2001</i><br><br>"In a time that which celebrates fame, success, stupidity, convenience and noise, here is the perfect antidote..." -- <i>John Lanchester, The Daily Telegraph, 12 May 2001</i><br><br>"a haunting mosaic of dreams, psychological notations, autobiographical vignettes, shards of literary theory and criticism and maxims." -- <i>George Steiner, The Observer, 3 June 2001</i><br><br>'. . . readers of Zenith's edition will find it supersedes all others in its delicacy of style, rigorous scholarship...' -- <i>John Gray, New Statesman, 28 May 2001</i><br><br>'...has done an heroic job in producing the best English-language version we are likely to see for a long time, if ever.' -- <i>Nicholas Lezard, The Guardian, 9 June 2001</i><br><br>'I love this strange work of fiction and I love the inventive, hard-drinking, modest man who wrote it in obscurity.' -- <i>Paul Bailey, The Independent, 22 June 2001</i>Fernando Pessoa (1888-1935) was born in Lisbon and brought up in Durban, South Africa. He returned to Lisbon in 1905. A prolific writer, ascribing his work to a variety of personas or heteronyms, Pessoa published little in his lifetime and supported himself by working as a commercial translator. Although acknowledged as an intellectual and a poet, his literary genius went largely unrecognised until after his death.</p><h2>The Haviland Touch</h2><p>It's been ten years since Spencer Wyatt jilted Drew Haviland for another man.

Phelan's three ex-wives, their grasping spawn, a legion of lawyers, several psychiatrists, and a plethora of sound technicians wait breathlessly, all eyes glued to digital monitors as they watch the old man read his verdict. But Phelan shocks everyone with a bizarre, last-gasp attempt to redistribute the spoils, setting in motion a legal morality tale of a contested will, sin, and redemption.<p> Our hero, Nate O'Riley--a washed-up, alcoholic litigator with two ruined marriages in his wake and the IRS on his tail--is dispatched to the Brazilian wetlands in search of a mysterious heir named in the will. After a harrowing trip upriver to a remote settlement in the Pantanal, he encounters Rachel Lane, a pure-hearted missionary living with an indigenous tribe and carrying out "God's work." Rachel's grave dedication and kindness impress the jaded lawyer, so much that a nasty bout of dengue fever leads him to a vision that could change his life.</p><p> Back in the States, the legal proceedings drag on and Grisham has a high time with Phelan's money-hungry descendents, a regrettable bunch who squandered millions, married strippers, got druggy, and befriended the Mob. The youngest son, Ramble, is a multi-pierced, tattoo-covered malcontent with big dreams for his rock band, the Demon Monkeys. Will Nate get straight with Rachel's aid? Do the greedy heirs get theirs? What's the real legacy of a lifetime's work? <i>The Testament</i> is classic Grisham: a down-and-out lawyer, a lot of money, an action-packed pursuit, and the highest issues at stake. It's not just about great characters; it's about the question of what character is. <i>--Rebekah Warren</i></p>"An entertaining page-turner...his best novel in years."<br>--<i>USA Today</i><br><br>"A compulsory page-turner."<br>--<i>Newsweek</i><br><br>"Entertaining."<br>--<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"Absorbing...the pages fly by."<br>--<i>Chicago Tribune</i></p><h2>Ceramics for Beginners: Hand Building (A Lark Ceramics Book)</h2><p>Ceramics are always popular with crafters, and hand building with low-fire earthenware is a natural place to start.

The Thoreau of <i>our</i> time&#x2014;valorized anarchist, founding environmentalist, and fervid advocate of civil disobedience&#x2014;did not exist in the nineteenth century. In this rich and appealing collection, Sandra Harbert Petrulionis untangles Thoreau&#x2019;s multiple identities by offering a wide range of nineteenth-century commentary as the opinions of those who knew him evolved over time.<p>The forty-nine recollections gathered in <i>Thoreau in His Own Time</i> demonstrate that it was those who knew him personally, rather than his contemporary literati, who most prized Thoreau&#x2019;s message, but even those who disparaged him respected his unabashed example of an unconventional life. Included are comments by Ralph Waldo Emerson&#x2014;friend, mentor, Walden landlord, and progenitor of the spin on Thoreau&#x2019;s posthumous reputation; Nathaniel Hawthorne, who could not compliment Thoreau without simultaneously denigrating him; and John Weiss, whose extended commentary on Thoreau&#x2019;s spirituality reflects unusual tolerance. Selections from the correspondence of Caroline Healey Dall, Maria Thoreau, Sophia Hawthorne, Sarah Alden Bradford Ripley, and Amanda Mather amplify our understanding of the ways in which nineteenth-century women viewed Thoreau. An excerpt by John Burroughs, who alternately honored and condemned Thoreau, asserts his view that Thoreau was ever searching for the unattainable.</p><p>The dozens of primary sources in this crisply edited collection illustrate the complexity of Thoreau&#x2019;s iconoclastic singularity in a way that no one biographer could. Each entry is introduced by a headnote that places the selection in historical and cultural context. Petrulionis&#x2019;s comprehensive introduction and her detailed chronology of personal and literary events in Thoreau&#x2019;s life provide a lively and informative gateway to the entries themselves. The collaborative biography that Petrulionis creates in <i>Thoreau in His Own Time</i> contextualizes the strikingly divergent views held by his contemporaries and highlights the reasons behind his profound legacy.</p></p><p>Author of <i>To Set This World Right:</i><i>The Antislavery Movement in Thoreau&#x2019;s Concord</i>, editor of <i>Journal 8: 1854</i> in <i>The Writings of Henry D.

Samuel Oliver, rector of Lambley, Nottinghamshire. He believed that the Order was to be found in the earliest periods of recorded history. It was taught by Seth to his descendants, and practiced by them under the name of Primitive or Pure Freemasonry. It passed over to Noah, and at the dispersion of mankind suffered a division into Pure and Spurious. Pure Freemasonry descended through the Patriarchs to Solomon, and thence on to the present day. Oliver was initiated in 1801 at the age of 19 by his father, in Saint Peter&#x2019;s Lodge No. 442 in the city of Peterborough. He entered Holy Orders in the Church of England in 1813, and in 1835 the Archbishop of Canterbury conferred upon him the degree of Doctor of Divinity. He read with great attention every Masonic book he could obtain, and began to collect a store of knowledge which he afterward used with so much advantage to the Craft. His first contribution to Masonic literature was a work titled &#x201c;The Antiquities of Freemasonry&#x201d; which was published in 1839. His next work titled &#x201c;The Star in the East&#x201d;, intended to show the connection between Freemasonry and religion. In 1841 he published his lectures on &#x201c;The Signs and Symbols of Freemasonry&#x201d;, in which he went into detail of the history and signification of all the recognized symbols of the Order. This was followed by lectures on &#x201c;The History of Initiation&#x201d;, comprising a detailed account of the Rites and Ceremonies, Doctrines and Discipline, of all the Secret and Mysterious Institutions of the Ancient World. The professed object of the author was to show the resemblances between these ancient systems of initiation and the Masonic, and to trace them to a common origin. His &#x201c;Institutes of Masonic Jurisprudence&#x201d;, was a book in which he expressed views of law that did not meet with the universal concurrence of his English readers. Besides these elaborate works, Oliver was a constant contributor to the early volumes of the London Freemasons Quarterly Review In 1815 he became a member of the AASR in England and in 1845 was promoted by the SC to the 33rd Degree while in the same year was appointed Lieutenant Grand Commander, being advanced in 1850 to the highest dignity, that of Most Puissant Sovereign Grand Commander. In 1846 the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts conferred upon him the honorary rank of Deputy Grand Master.</p><h2>RG Veda Volume 4</h2><p>Three hundred years ago, a warlord overthrew the Emperor of Heaven and began a cruel and tyrannical reign, but a prophecy foresaw that Six Stars could bring about his downfall, and Yasha is determined to make the prophecy come true.</p><p></p><h2>Joseph Maria Olbrich</h2><p>A major monograph in English about Joseph Maria Olbrich, architect, designer, educator.

It is the key to Middle East peace, the voice of the Arab world and the crossroads between Europe and Africa. Its historical and strategic importance is unparalleled. In short, Egypt matters. And the key to Egypt - its colourful past, chaotic present and uncertain future - is the Nile...From Herodotus&#39;s day to the present political upheavals, the steady flow of the Nile has been Egypt&#39;s heartbeat. It has shaped its geography, controlled its economy and moulded its civilisation. The same stretch of water which conveyed Pharaonic battleships, Ptolemaic grain ships, Roman troop-carriers and Victorian steamers today carries modern-day tourists past bankside settlements in which rural life - fishing, farming, flooding - continues much as it has for millennia. At this most critical juncture in the country&#39;s history, foremost Egyptologist Toby Wilkinson takes us on a journey up the Nile, north from Lake Victoria, from Cataract to Cataract, past the Aswan Dam, to the delta. The country is a palimpsest, every age has left its trace: as we pass the Nilometer on the island of Elephantine which since the days of the Pharaohs has measured the height of Nile floodwaters to predict the following season&#39;s agricultural yield and set the parameters for the entire Egyptian economy, the wonders of Giza which bear the scars of assault by nineteenth-century archaeologists and the modern-day unbridled urban expansion of Cairo - and in Egypt&#39;s earliest art (prehistoric images of fish-traps carved into cliffs) and the Arab Spring (fought on the bridges of Cairo) - the Nile is our guide to understanding the past and present of this unique, chaotic, vital, conservative yet rapidly changing land.</p><p>Toby Wilkinson read Egyptology at Cambridge University and has been hailed by The Daily Telegraph as &#39;the foremost Egyptologist of his time&#39;. Since January 2004 he has been a Fellow of Clare College, Cambridge.

Using illustrations in round-cornered squares of various sizes to contrast scenes from the larger human perspective with smaller vignettes pinpointing the mouse's activities, Schories cleverly sequences her pictorial narrative, always focusing attention on what happens next. Her humans may be merely serviceable and her mouse more toy than live creature, but the astutely observed action here is consistently amusing and the overall design and organization are nicely harmonious. An unusually strong debut. (Picture book. 2-8) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>PreSchool-Grade 2-- Illustrations of varying sizes depict the wordless, inadvertent travels of a young mouse who falls from his safe nest in the cellar into a plumber's pocket. From there he journeys via doughnut, slipper, and toy truck (among other unorthodox methods) throughout a busy town. The trip is a circular one and he eventually returns home, although there is no indication that this is intentional. The many detours and adventures seem entirely random, which weakens the story's impact considerably. Schories injects some mild suspense as the mouse narrowly escapes various tragedies, but these do little to add depth. Because of their arbitrary nature, they indicate neither the mouse's bravery or intelligence, nor are they sufficiently exaggerated to create an atmosphere of slapstick humor. The illustrations are adequate, although the world they portray is decidedly bland. Those searching for a compelling plot or intriguing characterization will be disappointed by this slim adventure, but less demanding onlookers may find it diverting. --Lisa Dennis, Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Photographic Art of Hoyningen-Huene</h2><p>George Hoyningen-Huene was born into the privileged world of the Russian aristocracy at the turn of the century. In Paris, as a refugee from the Revolution, he worked for Vogue, first as an illustrator and then as a supremely successful fashion photographer. Confidently, even imperiously, he created unprecedented images of perfect elegance by means of models, clothes, and, above all, the manipulation of light. Moving in the 1930s to Harper&#39;s Bazaar, he extended his range to portraiture and travel, capturing artists, composers, Hollywood stars, and the landscapes of Africa, Greece, Egypt, and Mexico in timeless visions of classical harmony. Two hundred and twenty-five superbly reproduced color and duotone illustrations display the full range of Hoyningen-Huene&#39;s talent. They have been chosen by William A. Ewing, Director of the Musee de l&#39;Elysee in Lausanne, who also provides an account of the photographer&#39;s career, drawing extensively on his unpublished memoirs. He shows how Hoyningen-Huene&#39;s style and techniques were shaped by his aristocratic upbringing, by his collaboration with Man Ray, by his intimate contacts with the artistic milieu of 1920s Paris, and by the influence of the photographers Edward Steichen and Baron de Meyer. Little-known aspects of his life, such as his work in Hollywood as color coordinator for George Cukor, are discussed. The text concludes with a survey of his importance for photographers as diverse and distinguished as Avedon, Penn, and Horst.</p><p>From unpublished memoirs and other sources, Ewing (Style and Motion, etc.) offers a comprehensive picture biography of Geoge Hoyningen-Huene, who was born into Russia's aristocracy and in the Paris of the '20s and '30s became a quintessential sophisticate among fashion magazine photographers. For Vogue, Vanity Fair and Harper's Bazaar he provided location and studio portraits of models, designers, film stars, authors, poets and society's darlings. Influenced by Man Ray, Baron de Meyer and Edward Steichen, Hoyningen-Huene set a standard of elegance in a genre later taken further by Horst, Penn and Avedon. In this volume's richly reproduced portraitsamong them Coco Chanel, Cocteau, Chaplin, Stravinsky, the Windsors, Lifar, Dolores Del Rio and Garboartist and subject combine superlatively in what came to be known as glamour. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.Hoyningen-Huene, called Huene, was one of fashion's most elite photographers. Born into an aristocratic family in Russia in 1900, Huene was well educated. Having fled the Revolution, he began a career in illustration in Paris that led into fashion photography. His work for Paris Vogue and Harper's Bazaar recalled his early passion for what Ewing calls "the cult of the classical." With help from Huene's memoirs and friends, Ewing brings the man and his lesser known portraits, documentary images, and Hollywood work into focus, and discusses Huene's artistic milieu and trends in both fashion and photography. This luxurious book with over 200 duotone images and 11 color plates is full of the glamour that characterized the artist's life and work.Ann Copeland, Drew Univ .

"Well, Augustine, you are about to become a father again. How do you feel about it?"<br>"Humble, I suppose," Augustine replied. "Though Jane and I had children before she died, this child is Mary's first, and we have many plans for him. If it's a boy, we plan to call him George, after our sovereign."<br>"Ah, things will become different--quite different--I'll wager," said the other man, "between what you know of English royalty and what your George will know. You never were much of a hand to talk politics, and you seem not to care a hoot what becomes of these American colonies. If it is a boy, I predict that he will grow into a man who will take an interest in our conditions here. It would serve you right if he turned out not to be so loyal to the king he is going to be named after. But I will not bore you any more with such chatter.... We must talk and think of what a beautiful night it was last night. And that great white screaming comet that paled all the stars--how magnificent! This man Halley who calls himself an astronomer, his father boiled soap, made himself wealthy, and this son sees a comet--when was it? 1682--and predicts that it would show again seventy-six years later. By jove, he was right! It occurs to me that we won't either of us live to see the next one."<br>A Negro slave girl came running out upon the porch and cried, "Massa Washington, Massa Doctor, the time has come."<br>* * *<br>Four tranquil February the twenty-seconds passed over the Bridge Creek plantation, adding years to Augustine's life, new cultivated acres to his plantation, and numbers to his slaves. Mary was fond of commenting on her young son's precociousness. "He's very much different from the others," she said often to her patient husband.<br>"And what do you mean by different?" asked Augustine, smiling.<br>"Oh, he's much larger than most boys of that age," she returned earnestly. "He has a violent temper. Runs away into the woods every chance he gets. They found him stark naked on several occasions. Seems to hate his clothes and to be washed clean. He does so many queer things like squatting on the ground and watching a hole. There are so many things, all normal I think, but different from what I have observed in other children."<br>"Mary, that is not so different from other boys," observed her husband thoughtfully, divided between amusement and gravity. "He's your only child, and it's quite natural that you should imagine little George is reserved for some special and noble place in the world. I hope so. We will need great men in the troublesome times ahead."<br>"Augustine, you are always predicting a dark future for the colonists. Nothing has happened to worry us since George was born. We are certainly better off, and you have more leisure than ever. In fact, too much leisure. I think you take Lawrence hunting and fishing too often, and I am worried because little George shows undue interest in those idle pursuits."<br>"Mary, the best foundation for a youth in this country is to learn the ways of the woods and water. American boys will be dependent on their guns and fishing poles for a living. I would be very glad if George took to the woods like an Indian. There is much to learn from the Indians."<br>"But we hear more and more all the time about the growing hostility of the Indians and their fraternizing with the French. I certainly don't want George learning anything from those red men."<br>The oldest son Lawrence entered the big sitting room, bringing with him the odors of the woods. He was now eighteen years old, a tall, sallow young man, not robust and strong.<br>"Mother, what do you think George has been doing?" he asked in a pleasant voice.<br>"Oh, gracious me, I have no idea," she returned in excitement. "Tell me."<br>"Well, it appears that George's slave, William, turned his back a moment, and George made off into the woods. When William found him he had fallen into Muddy Slough. It was quite deep water, but what do you think? The young rascal didn't drown. Maybe he was too fat to sink. Maybe he held to some bushes or something. William was too frightened to observe what kept him up. He fished George out and fetched him back home. I saw them when they came past the barn. George was a sight to behold but not in the least concerned. He's a great youngster."<br>"I fear he must be punished," murmured Mary, as she left the room.<br>"So you think your little stepbrother is a great youngster?" inquired Augustine, with keen eyes on Lawrence.<br>"I certainly do," returned the young fellow heartily. "I always was fond of George, and lately I have been paying more attention to him. He interests me more than my own brothers. When he gets a little older I will surely make a chum of him."<br>"Lawrence, that's fine," said the father feelingly. "Only don't wait. He's big enough now to learn the ways of outdoors. His mother will not approve and surely she won't allow us to take George on any camping trips, but begin to teach him what you can. Precocious or not, he's not quite old enough for his letters yet, but a youngster is never too young to get his first lessons in outdoors."<br>"Father, that boy is old for his age. He stole my fishing pole and hid it in the bushes. When I taxed him about it, he did not commit himself, but when I found it, he frankly said he put it there. George is clever and deep, but he's honest."<br>Mary paused in the spacious dining room and gazed at the picture of her father which hung above the mantelpiece: a noble picture of a man whose stature equaled his qualities. She had always been convinced that little George looked more like her father than anyone else. And it had been her secret prayer that he would inherit those qualities which her parent had possessed. During the prolonged months while she waited for George to come, her imaginative and dreamy nature had come to have full sway. She did not believe that she was unduly foolish or sentimental; yet there was something she felt but could not explain. Her own mother, and other women who had confided intimately with her, had related natural ambitions and hopes for their offsprings; however, no one she knew had ever been so possessed before the birth of her child with the fantasies and songs of her inmost soul which seemed to have had their origins in the convictions that her son had been born for an unusual and great life.<br>The few timid overtures she had made to her husband that might have led to full confession had always been inhibited by his amused tolerance and convictions of his own about his son. He wanted George to be a hunter, fisherman, planter, and a good subject to the King. Mary believed secretly that, loyal as the colonists were, the time would come when they would want to make their own lives and their own state, but she had never dared speak her mind.<br>She went out across the yard and looked everywhere, calling George. She finally found him at the woodpile, busily tearing it down. He was a sight to behold: soaked from head to foot, with a bloody scratch on the back of his leg. Along with Mary's serious thought about him, she felt a thrill at his size and energy. At the moment he had none of the handsome attributes which she took so much pride in.<br>"George," she called severely, halting behind him. "What are you doing?"<br>The urchin ceased tearing at the sticks of wood and turned around. He had wiped the mud from his face, but it was still streaked and stained. "I'm chasing a chipmunk," he replied.<br>"Did it occur to you that the chipmunk might have a nest in there and might have young ones?" she asked.<br>"I didn't think about that. I jest wanted to ketch him."<br>"Well, George, you may desist in your play and listen to me. I do not need to be told that you have disobeyed me and fallen into Muddy Slough."<br>"Mother, I didn't promise I wouldn't fall in, an' William took me."<br>"How did it come that William let you fall into the water?"<br>"It was my fault, Mother. I said I'd sit still while he went for fishing worms. An'--an' I didn't."<br>"Why didn't you?" queried his mother reprovingly.<br>"I don't know. I saw a little turtle, an'--an' then I forgot."<br>"You slipped in the water, of course, and then what happened?"<br>"I held to the bushes an' waited for William."<br>"Did you cry out--call for him?" she inquired wonderingly.<br>"No. I wasn't scared."<br>"George, you will have to be punished for this," she cried.<br>He gazed up at her with clear apprehensive eyes. Then he dropped his head.<br>"You understand, of course, that William will have to be punished too."<br>"But he didn't do nothin'," protested the lad.<br>Mary, hands trembling, broke off a switch from a nearby bush. She had never punished George before. He watched her with steady, unflinching eyes.<br>"George, if you promise not to do it again, the punishment will not be so severe. Will you promise?"<br>"Mother, I promised before an' I did it anyhow, so I won't promise."<br>She laid hold of her unresisting boy, and, with her heart mounting to her throat, she switched him over his bare leg. As she had never done this before and was under stress, she must have struck harder than she had any idea. He grew stiff under her hold but did not resist or cry out. When she saw welts coming upon his legs, she desisted.<br>"Now, sir, do wash yourself and put on clean clothes. You are to stay in the house, but you will not get any supper tonight."<br>As she let him go, he ran off swiftly around the back of the house. It was then as she stood holding the switch, remorseful in spite of herself, that she heard him hollering. That relieved her somewhat for it was her opinion that children who did not cry when they were whipped were not normal. As she turned to go in, she saw William dart from behind the shed where evidently he had watched the performance, and the fleeting glimpse she had of his face showed that he was frightened. She would consult Augustine about what kind of punishment to mete out for William. What she did not feel at all right about was the punishment she had given George, and this caused her concern. Probably she would not be able to repeat it, and the incident showed her that George had passed babyhood and was fast growing up.<br>William was not the only witness to that unprecedented switching near the woodpile. Lawrence, too, had spied on the scene. It recalled to him the many switchings he had endured when he was that age and older. He was particularly intrigued by the way little George had manfully taken his licking. But, presently, when Lawrence had made his escape from his hiding place into the house, he was suddenly brought to a standstill by George's lusty yowling. He was glad none of his brothers and sisters were around to enjoy George's pain and grief, and he began to feel a little sorry himself for the youngster. After all, if George had taken the punishment without a whimper, it would have made the boy seem unnatural.<br>Lawrence went into his room and waited a while until George's caterwauling had subsided. Then he tiptoed to the door, and, knocking, he entered. He found the youngster seated on the floor, dirty and ragged, with his long locks hanging down over his head. Tearstains had added further to his forlorn aspect. George had a leg turned around and was rubbing the back of it where little welts ran across the calf. Lawrence was shocked to see blood. George's mother must have whipped him cruelly. Slumping down on the floor beside him, he said, "George let me see? Oh, does it hurt?"<br>George looked up as if he thought that question was silly.<br>"Of course it hurts, but the thing to do is to think that it doesn't," said Lawrence.<br>"How's I gonna-do that?" sniffled George.<br>"It seems funny, but it can be done,...This is a bad scratch, George. It'll have to be bound up. I first thought Mother's switch had cut it out of you."<br>"I cut myself there--then I fell in....And Mother whipped me right over it. It hurts--something awful."<br>"Sure it does; you forget it. I'll tie it up for you and help you wash and change your clothes, and then I have something wonderful to tell you."<br>George did not show any interest and went on tenderly rubbing his leg until Lawrence wiped the blood and the dirt away and tied up the wound.<br>"Young man, I'll bet you will be interested when I tell you. Where's some of your clean clothes? Here's some....Where's your towel? Here it is, and almost as dirty as you are. George, did you know that Indian boys are cleaner than you are?"<br>"Injuns!" exclaimed George, looking up.<br>"Yes, but of course they don't wear very much. Stand up now till I fix you. And, listen, I don't think Father will punish you. A man doesn't think it's so bad when a boy falls in the water or gets dirty and soils his clothes. Mother is very particular about such things. She insists on you and your brothers being little gentlemen all the while. I told Father about your stealing my fishing pole and that you wouldn't deny it. He doesn't think you are too young to learn something about the outdoors. So I am hoping to take you in hand. Every day we'll do something. We'll fish Muddy Slough and Ridge Creek and then the river. I know a great deal about hunting and fishing, and all about the birds and squirrels and snakes and turkeys and everything in the woods, and I'm going to teach you."<br>Long before Lawrence had gotten that far in his information, George had forgotten his pain and that he hated to have his face washed and his hair combed and was standing erect, tingling all over, with his large eyes shining, fixed raptly upon his brother.<br>"An' Injuns!" he burst out.<br>"Yes, Injuns too. We may see some now and then, but, George, most all the Injuns now are bad Injuns. We'll have to be pretty careful when we go far away into the woods."<br>"An' will I get to go campin' out with Father an' you?"<br>"Sure you will, someday, when you have learned a lot and can better take care of yourself."<br>"An' can I have a fishin' pole of my own?"<br>"I'll give you that small one you stole from me on condition you'll never steal anything again. Promise?"<br>"I will, promise," replied George solemnly.<br>"And soon as you learn how to use it, you shall have a knife, and then someday a tomahawk."<br>"An Injun hatchet?" rejoined George breathlessly.<br>"Yes, someday. It depends on how much you learn and how much you mind your teacher.

Lawrence considered the moment as definitely establishing a new relationship with the youngster. Young as George was, he had something that drew Lawrence to him.

"Now, George, you go to Mother and tell her you're sorry and that you'll never do it again." They went into the dining room and there, before the other children and his father, George approached his mother and without embarrassment or timidity made his plea to her. And Mary, quite surprised and touched, looked from George to her husband and then back again to tell George that, as he had made amends, he could have his...</p><h2>The Clearing</h2><p>In the years before World War I, Byron Aldridge led a charmed life as the charismatic heir apparent to a Pennsylvania timber empire; and to his younger brother, Randolph, he was both guide and idol. But he returned from France a different man and was not home long before those festering memories sent him drifting from one settlement to another, working as a lawman, and then disappearing altogether.<br><br>Finally his family discovers him in a remote Louisiana mill town, promptly buys the property, and puts Randolph in charge of this place unlike any he has ever seen, where men are surrounded by cypress swamps and menace, leading lives of ceaseless, backbreaking toil punctuated only by the brutal entertainments provided by the Sicilians who control the whiskey and card games and girls, and by the rough justice meted out by the still-tormented Byron. Randolph struggles to understand him, and to regain his trust, even as their wives presently contend with their own hopes and disappointments and while the future grows uncertain yet fearsome all around them.<br><br>This is a story about family, about marriage, about what sustains people through loss; it is a reckoning of the sacrifices they must make in order to establish a community in the deepest wilderness, and to defend what is most precious to them. Palpably atmospheric, with a remarkable range of characters and emotions, <b>The Clearing </b>displays more powerfully than ever before Tim Gautreaux&#x2019;s masterful understanding of time, place, and human nature.</p><p>In Tim Gautreaux's first novel, <i>The Next Step in the Dance</i>, the author staked a literary claim to Louisiana bayou country. In his second novel, <i>The Clearing</i>, he colonizes that claim. The atmosphere of the novel is humid and snake-infested, a swamp alive with mosquitoes and hungry alligators, stinkbugs and stench, flooding and freezing alternately. The setting provides a fitting backdrop for the bare subsistence lives of the people who live there.<p> The time is 1923, the place a family-owned mill, and the people a motley collection made up of a manager from Pennsylvania, his brother the constable, poor white and black loggers, three women, Sicilians, and polyglot Cajuns. Byron, the constable, a golden boy before the war, eldest son and heir apparent to a timber fortune, returned from France a damaged man, no longer interested in family or future. He drifted away from home and lost contact. When the novel begins, he has been found in this Louisiana backwater and his brother, Randolph, is dispatched to manage the family mill until the cypress forest is cleared and to bring Byron home. What happens to them in this hermetically sealed redoubt is a story of intense and forgiving brotherly love, as Randolph struggles to reclaim Byron and to maintain decency against formidable odds. They must deal with the Sicilians who own the gambling, liquor and women and will do anything to hang onto this franchise; the loggers who work and fight in equal part; and each other, not as the boys they were, but as the men they are.</p><p> You might learn more about old-time logging than you ever wanted to know, but the story is as compelling as <i>Cold Mountain</i> or <i>All the Pretty Horses</i> and just as well written. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p>&#x201c;Gautreaux writes beautifully about terrible things, about war and life and death . . .

M. Roberts's bestselling <em>History of the World</em>. Now completely revised and updated, this comprehensive 10-volume set traces the tumultuous story of humankind from the origins of Homo sapiens to the most recent upheavals in Africa and the Balkans. The rise and fall of civilizations; war, revolution, and peace; the attempts of peoples to mold and sustain their national identities; the impact of powerful individuals on world events; the interplay of state and religion; the social and economic factors that influence societies--these are some of the themes of this masterful, sweeping narrative. More than 2,000 photographs in color and black and white present a unique visual panoply of the march of history. In addition, more than 200 maps and artworks in full color bring complex situations into clear focus. Fully integrated sidebars and feature boxes narrow in on key themes, providing an additional layer of interest. Each volume also contains a double-page, illustrated chronology of major events, plus a bibliography and detailed index.<br> Dr. Roberts' revisions to the ancient history portion of the text, made specifically for this edition, ensure that the latest findings of archaeology and anthropology are taken into account. At the opposite extreme of the timescale--the modern world at the threshold of the 21st century--the distinguished author has amended the existing text and added new chapters to reflect all the complex adjustments in the balance of politics and power since the first edition was published in 1976. Authoritative, brilliantly written, and superbly illustrated, this outstanding and popular work of scholarship makes the whole sweep of history vivid and accessible as never before.<br> <strong>The volumes of </strong><strong><em>The Illustrated History of the World</em></strong><strong> are:</strong><br> I. Prehistory and the First Civilizations<br> II. Eastern Asia and Classical Greece<br> III. Rome and the Classical West<br> IV. The Age of Diverging Traditions<br> V. The Far East and a New Europe<br> VI. The Making of the European Age<br> VII. The Age of Revolution<br> VIII. The European Empires<br> IX. Emerging Powers<br> X. The New Global Era</p><p><br><strong>J.M. Roberts</strong> is the highly-acclaimed author of <em>History of the World</em> (OUP, 1993) and the best-selling <em>A History of Europe</em>. He is the Warden of Merton College, Oxford, England.<br>This history covers the time period from prehistory to 1997. It is notable for its many time lines, charts, maps, drawings, illustrations, and photographs, which complement the text and bring it to life.<p>The set is a revision of <i>History of the World </i>(1976) by Roberts, a British historian, professor, editor, and author. He points out that any history of the world must be selective. In this one he has tried "to set our events, movements, determining facts and circumstances which have shaped most human lives." He emphasizes the most significant civilizations and tells their stories in all their interconnectedness, highlighting their most important contributions. The tone is optimistic, stressing human power to manage nature, overcome obstacles, and bring about conscious change.</p><p>Primary arrangement is chronological by volume, with the chapters within each volume combining a thematic and geographic approach. For example, volume one, <i>Prehistory and the First Civilizations,</i> includes chapters on "Early Civilized Life," "Ancient Mesopotamia," and "Ancient Egypt." Some topics covered in "Ancient Egypt" are Mesopotamian influence, the role of the Nile, agriculture, religion, death and burial, hieroglyphic writing, the invention of papyrus, and the pyramids, as well as political topics, individuals, and the Old, Middle, and New Kingdoms. These topics are covered with little detail, however. The significance of hieroglyphic writing is related in one long paragraph, but there are no details or illustrations of how it is done. Each volume has its own index and contents list, in addition to a series contents page telling the time periods and events covered in each volume. There is no cumulative index.</p><p>Roberts' goal of telling the main points of civilizations leads to his coverage being less detailed than sets it can be compared to, such as Time Life's <i>Time Frame</i> (1987^-1999)<i> </i>and<i> Lost Civilizations</i> (1992^-1999), or <i>History of the Ancient and Medieval World </i>[RBB O 15 97] and <i>History of the Modern World </i>(see review on p.1491). However, it gives a broad view and does lead to a quick identification of the main facts, which is often very useful. Its distillation of topics makes it valuable for younger readers, from the fifth grade through high school, and for this group it would be valuable both as a reference set and as circulating volumes. The fact that each volume can stand alone also makes it appropriate for the circulating collection for adults. <i></i></p></p><h2>The Expression of The Emotions in Man and Animals</h2><p>The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals is a book by Charles Darwin, published in 1872, concerning genetically determined aspects of behaviour. It was published thirteen years after On the Origin of Species and, alongside his 1871 book The Descent of Man (of which it was originally intended to form a part), it is Darwin&#39;s main consideration of human origins. In this book, Darwin seeks to trace the origins of such human characteristics as the pursing of the lips in moments of concentration and the mental confusion which typically accompanies blushing. Before Darwin, mental life had often been considered in terms of associationist psychology. Darwin&#39;s biological approach links mental states to the neurological organization of movement; and he sought out the opinions of some leading British psychiatrists, notably James Crichton-Browne, in the preparation of the book which forms his main contribution to psychology. Amongst the innovations with this book are Darwin&#39;s circulation of a questionnaire in his preparatory research; simple psychology experiments on emotional recognition with his friends and family; and (borrowing from Duchenne de Boulogne, a physician at the Salp�tri�re) the use of photographs in his presentation of scientific information. The Expression of the Emotions is an important landmark in the history of book illustration.</p><p>&#34;Even cows, when they frisk about from pleasure, throw up their tails in a ridiculous fashion.&#34; So writes Charles Darwin in his magnum opus on how humans and animals display such emotions as fear, anger, disdain, and pleasure; it is work that has in most respects been sustained by later scientific research. First published in 1872, Darwin&#39;s greatest work was never issued in quite the shape its author intended: bits and pieces were left out of subsequent printings, most of them released after Darwin&#39;s death, and later editors made additions to suit the intellectual fashion of their times. This definitive edition, heavily annotated, brings us the book that Darwin would have wanted, and it is essential to any naturalist&#39;s library.A study of the muscular movements of the face (both human and animal) triggered by the emotions being felt - a &#39;physical&#39; response to a &#39;mental&#39; sensation. Darwin&#39;s detailed analysis of what actually happens to the body in a state of fear, or joy, or anger is illustrated by photographic images.</p><h2>Divine Rebel: The Life of Anne Marbury Hutchinson</h2><p>Divine Rebel: The Life of Anne Marbury Hutchinson</p><p></p><h2>The First Shall Be Last (Avalon Mystery)</h2><p>As the snow falls in Diamond Springs, the mood shifts, bringing with it a string of suspicious events.

She teams up with FBI agent Brewster in an elaborate scam that involves Sharyn breaking up with her beloved boyfriend, Montgomery County medical examiner Nick Thomopolis, in order to date Winter. In addition, she must find the hit-and-run driver who killed young mother Michelle Frey.

First, a corpus is discovered: the unpublished works of Cornell Woolrich, a popular writer of the 1940s, remembered for such classics as The Bride Wore Black and The Night Has a Thousand Eyes. In its midst is the torso of Into the Night, minus a beginning, end and a few other parts. Lawrence Block, author of the Matt Scudder and Evan Tanner series, is invited to fill in the blanks. The final product is a sort of Frankenstein that claims as its victims the reputations of both writers. The book tells the story of Madeline, a lonely girl who tries to commit suicide. When, to her relief, the gun jams, she tosses it on a table, causing it to discharge a bullet that flies through her window, crosses the street and kills Starr, a girl rather like herself. Filled with guilt, she digs into her victim's past and when she discovers that Starr has been emotionally slain by an ill-fated marriage, she determines to expiate her own crime by plotting the destruction of Starr's husband. Better editing might have expunged the book's conflicting statements, anachronisms and unbelievable coincidences, but one suspects that Woolrich knew exactly what he was doing when he put it aside. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Crush (Yale Series of Younger Poets)</h2><p>Richard Siken&#x2019;s <i>Crush</i>, selected as the 2004 winner of the Yale Younger Poets prize, is a powerful collection of poems driven by obsession and love.

She cannot believe he took his own life and wonders if it wasn't really murder. Trying to escape her memories, she seeks peace at Windtop in Cold Spring Harbor. But strange and frightening things keep happening--voices sing the song she wrote for Ricky and guitars play from nowhere. Windtop has become a trap, but Hollis Sands will not leave, until she discovers the truth, no matter how close to death that takes her....</p><p><p><strong>Phyllis A. Whitney</strong> (1903-2008) was born of American parents in Yokohama, Japan. She worked with books throughout her life as a librarian, bookseller, reviewer, writing teacher, and bestselling author. She was one of America's most successful writers of romance and suspense and in 1988 won the Grand Master Award from the Mystery Writers of America.</p>Songwriter Hollis Sands's world collapses when her husband, legendary singer Ricky Sands, commits suicide. Wanting to escape the press and the pain, Hollis flees in anonymity to Windtop, the beautiful and imposing Long Island home of a family friend. The peaceful retreat soon turns nightmarish as small reminders of Ricky keep surfacing, and an eerie version of Hollis's "Rainsong" echoes throughout the house. Convinced that Windtop harbors secrets about Ricky, Hollis remains at the house, determined to discover the truth about her tormentor and the reasons for Ricky's death. Reader Anna Fields's nearly monotone narration, although slightly difficult to adjust to, is well suited for this modern gothic tale. The wistfulness permeating her voice weaves an aura of lonely terror and takes the reader to the heart of Hollis's grief, fear, and hope. Unfortunately, Fields uses this quality to excess. The moments of relief from tension are not mirrored in her voice, making the book feel a bit too melodramatic.

In riveting detail, author James W. Douglass shows as he previously did with the story of JFK how police and security forces were complicit in the assassination and how in killing one man, they hoped to destroy his vision of peace, nonviolence, and reconciliation. Gandhi had long anticipated and prepared for this fate. In reviewing the little-known story of his early experiments in truth in South Africa the laboratory for Gandhi s philosophy of satyagraha, or truth force Douglass shows how early he confronted and overcame the fear of death. And, as with his account of JFK s death, he shows why this story matters: what we can learn from Gandhi s truth in the struggle for peace and reconciliation today.</p><p>James W. Douglass, a long-time scholar and peace activist, is the author of many books, including JFK and the Unspeakable: Why He Died and Why It Matters, widely acclaimed as one of the most important books ever written on the subject.

No other contemporary writer is exposing the mechanics of assassination as methodically and bravely as Douglass.

These stations, placed every twenty or thirty miles, ensured that travelers would be able to obtain grain for their livestock and food for themselves. They also sped up the process of mail delivery to remote Western outposts. Tragically, the easing of overland travel coincided with renewed conflicts with the Cheyenne and other Plains Indians. The massacre of Black Kettle&#39;s people at Sand Creek instigated two years of bloody reprisals and counterreprisals. &#34;Amid this turmoil and change, these daring women continued to build on the example set by earlier women pioneers. As Harriet Loughary wrote upon her arrival in California, &#34;[after] two thousands of miles in an ox team, making an average of eighteen miles a day enduring privations and dangers . . .

A rotting-food kind of smell drifted from the open window at the rear of the museum. Its visitors were long gone, its doors locked. The building itself wasn't terribly large, just two stories tall but a block wide. In fact, it was a rather ordinary building, without much in decoration, which made Jhen sneer. They showed more respect for their past back home, he decided. </p><p> Four figures moved quietly toward the window, ignoring the odor. Street lighting was minimal toward the rear and this helped hide their tall and thin silhouettes. After all, few Andorians were seen on Tellar, each race preferring to keep to themselves. </p><p> It occurred to Jhen that he never quite knew what the original problem was between these two people. He knew they had found one another long before there was a United Federation of Planets, but why two aggressive races did not form an alliance and conquer nearby worlds such as Alpha Centauri and Vulcan made no sense to him. It didn't matter, because the Andorians had their pride and if the Tellarites wouldn't be their allies they were to be considered potential adversaries. </p><p> When the dormant doorway lit up and Tolin saw it led to Tellar, it was she who suggested they step through and retrieve the revered artifact, the colAndor Scrolls. Jhen knew the history: how the Scrolls were brought to Tellar as part of a cultural exhibition. How they were used to show Tellar another way to organize their government. And how Ger, High Councillor to the First Seat of Tellar, spirited them away and threw the Andorian delegation off the planet. The Scrolls had been lost to the Andorians and skirmishes almost led to a war. Changes in both governments led to a truce some years later, but the Scrolls remained on Tellar. </p><p> Tolin tugged at Jhen's loose sleeve. He turned and saw her gesture toward the window. Below it was a stack of containers, sturdy enough to support them. How very careless of these arrogant creatures, Jhen thought. With a wave of his hand, Jhen directed his small party forward, inching toward their goal. No sound came from the building, so if it was guarded, it was from an artificial, not living, source. This made it simpler, as Tolin thumbed a palm-sized cylinder. Its purple light flared and she nodded in satisfaction. Now the automated surveillance would be fooled and they could move freely. She placed the cylinder just inside the window, fastening it to the interior wall. </p><p> Okud was the first one through the window, open more than enough to allow their slender forms through. The drop to the polished marble floor was less than a meter and was done with only the slightest of noises. Tolin followed, then Mako, and finally Jhen. All four stood within the room, breathing through their mouths to ignore as much of the stench as possible, which was stronger inside the building. Lighting was dim and Jhen could spot the various sensors, none of which changed from their amber status. The room they had entered was cluttered with stone carvings and paintings on metal. He knew even less of Tellarite culture than his companions, so he couldn't begin to guess what he was looking at. What he did know was that the workmanship was crude, like the Tellarites themselves. </p><p> Mako looked closely at one statue, that of a boy at play. He smiled at it, earning him a disapproving glance from Tolin. As far as Jhen was concerned, there was nothing to like about the heathen race, and Tolin seemed to agree. Reaching into a hidden pocket within her leather tunic, she extracted a folded piece of paper, opened it, and studied the map. Satisfied, she replaced it and pointed one light-blue-skinned finger to her right. </p><p> The quartet ignored the rest of the items surrounding them, heading straight for their objective. Passing through two more rooms, they finally saw a large chamber with a glass-covered pedestal. Within it was their objective: the Scrolls. Jhen silently counted to five, smiling that they were all together. Tolin grinned at him. Mako walked ahead of her to peer at the placard underneath the glass, trying to read the description. He growled in frustration; his knowledge of the Tellarite language was almost nonexistent, so he couldn't understand the words. </p><p> Remaining silent, Jhen pointed at Okud, who opened up a brown satchel that had been strapped to his back. The first object was palm-sized, oblong and dark. He removed it, thumbing a control set deep within the item. Its low hum indicated the localized disruptor was scrambling a spectrum of frequencies normally associated with security shielding. Withdrawing thin, elegant tools next, he made quick work of the sealant around the glass's base. A glance at the disruptor showed no warning lights, so Tolin and Jhen gently lifted the glass upward. Mako reverently touched the Scrolls, then placed each of them in the satchel. He nodded toward Jhen, signaling he was done. Okud absently disengaged the disruptor while Tolin reached once more into her bag when they were interrupted. </p><p> As expected from the outset, an undetected sensor was triggered and a keening sound came from the pedestal. The Tellarites weren't entirely stupid, they knew, but they figured they would get this far before being detected. They had speed working in their favor. </p><p> None of them hurried, but walked with long strides toward their window exit. Jhen saw that a metal plate was sliding down to cover it -- a standard security tactic. Tolin unholstered a hand-sized phaser, and fired. The amber beam turned the metal plate into molten slag, halting its movement. With a little more speed, they exited and began strolling away. Jhen had successfully found the back-alley route that would return them to the door, and home. </p><p> When a security detail arrived five minutes later, they went from room to room checking for damage. As they approached the chamber that once contained the Andorian Scrolls, they saw in its place a small figurine. It was of an Andorian female, in cleric's robes, praying.<br> </p><p> <i>"Grand Nagus!"</i> The voice was urgent, if high-pitched. It sounded like that of a child entering adolescence, cracking and nervous. </p><p> "Yes," said Grand Nagus Rom of the Ferengi Alliance. There were still mornings he woke up convinced this was the longest dream he had ever had. But no, he was really the Grand Nagus. He still remembered the day it happened, with vivid clarity: Zek, gnarled and cackling as usual, telling him it was time he and Ishka -- Rom's mother -- settled down into retirement. Since Rom shared Zek's vision for long-term changes in Ferengi society to insure its viability in an ever-shifting universe, the outgoing Grand Nagus asked Rom to succeed him. With his Bajoran wife Leeta by his side, Rom considered himself the luckiest man on the face of the planet. </p><p> Of course, not everyone agreed with Zek's logic, most notably Rom's older brother Quark. </p><p> <i>"Three Orion ships approaching orbit. They've already disabled forty-three percent of our satellite defenses!"</i> His voice grew even more excited, if that was possible. </p><p> Rom raised a hand to his left ear, making sure it was not blocked and that he heard the warning properly. Orions! They had no respect for the Rules of Acquisition, just plunder. They had proven incredibly unreliable business partners and even his older brother avoided working with them. But they had never ventured anywhere near Ferenginar before, so what did they want -- and how did they get so close without triggering the deep space sensor net? </p><p> Jumping to his feet, Rom left his soft, warm bed, letting the tall and sultry Leeta remain slumbering. If she was anything, he mused, slipping into a shiny robe, Leeta was a good sleeper. He began flipping switches on the desk he used for late-night accounting reviews. While he might have been poor with business, Rom was good with matters technica</p></p><h2>Shropshire: A Memoir of the English Countryside</h2><p>In a richly photographed memoir, the author of the Brother Cadfael mysteries explores Shropshire, a beautiful English shire that serves as the setting for her novels and is also the site of many medieval treasures. Tour.</p><p>Peters's mysteries, both modern and medieval, are set in Shropshire. The author of the enormously popular Brother Cadfael series here brings the grace and intensity of her prose to this finely detailed look at her home shire in western England. Peters (the pen name of Edith Pargeter) explains that when she was young her family activities and her later education were based in her home county, noting that the area is in her blood and that "the blood gets into the ink." Several specific sites utilized in her novels are illustrated among Ray Morgan's 55 lush, full-page color photos, including Long Mountains in The Heaven Tree and the Shrewsbury abbey of the Brother Cadfael chronicles. She discusses the region's history and geography in a casual yet satisfying way and gives care to describe the destruction and rebuilding of ancient churches. Readers who follow Peters as she moves from one medieval market town to the next, comments on the Welsh influence and describes Roman sites, will wish an area map had been included. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Illustrated History of Military Motorcycles</h2><p>Quality second hand book</p><p></p><h2>Frankenstein (Penguin Popular Classics)</h2><p>The epic battle between man and monster reaches its greatest pitch in the famous story of &#34;Frankenstein&#34;. In trying to create life, the young student Victor Frankenstein unleashes forces beyond his control, setting into motion a long and tragic chain of events that brings Victor himself to the very brink. How he tries to destroy his creation, as it destroys everything Victor loves, is a powerful story of love, friendship ...and horror.</p><p><i>Frankenstein,</i> loved by many decades of readers and praised by such eminent literary critics as Harold Bloom, seems hardly to need a recommendation. If you haven't read it recently, though, you may not remember the sweeping force of the prose, the grotesque, surreal imagery, and the multilayered <i>doppelg�nger</i> themes of Mary Shelley's masterpiece. As fantasy writer Jane Yolen writes of this (the reviewer's favorite) edition, "The strong black and whites of the main text [illustrations] are dark and brooding, with unremitting shadows and stark contrasts. But the central conversation with the monster--who owes nothing to the overused movie image ... but is rather the novel's charnel-house composite--is where [Barry] Moser's illustrations show their greatest power ... The viewer can all but smell the powerful stench of the monster's breath as its words spill out across the page. Strong book-making for one of the world's strongest and most remarkable books."

It was the last book to be published by him during his lifetime and won the W. H. Smith Award. It was also chosen by many critics and reviewers as one of their books of the year. Larkin died in December 1985. Further Requirements gathers together many other interviews, broadcasts, statements and reviews. Some of them date from the period after he had chosen the contents of Required Writing; others come from obscure publications, including some early pieces. Taken all together this collection of fugitive or reprinted material fills in a consistent but sometimes unexpected portrait of Philip Larkin - mordant, intolerant, generous, but always himself. It will give great pleasure to all admirers of his work. Required Writing was dedicated to Anthony Thwaite, one of Larkin&#39;s chosen literary executors, who has edited and introduced this new selection. He edited the birthday tribute Larkin at Sixty in 1982 and, after Larkin&#39;s death, both the Collected Poems and the Selected Letters.

The fort&#39;s elimination was essential for the success of Hitler&#39;s invasion of the West. Deemed impregnable to conventional attack, Hitler himself suggested the means for its capture with the first glider-borne assault in military history. On 10 May 1940, ten gliders carrying just 77 paratroopers landed on top of the fort. Using top-secret hollow-charge weapons for the first time in warfare, the assault pioneers of Sturmgruppe Granit subdued Fort Eben Emael within just 30 minutes, and the fortress surrendered within 30 hours. It remains one of the greatest raids in the annals of Special Forces.</p><p>Simon Dunstan is a well-established author, filmmaker and photographer in the field of military history, with several titles published by Osprey in the New Vanguard and Men-at-Arms series.

The book traces the development of cooking aboard in ancient and medieval times, through the development of seafaring traditions of storing and preparing food on the world&#x2019;s seas and oceans. <br>Following a largely chronological format, Simon Spalding shows how the raw materials, cooking and eating equipments, and methods of preparation of seafarers have both reflected the shoreside practices of their cultures, and differed from them. The economies of whole countries have developed around foods that could survive long trips by sea, and new technologies have evolved to expand the available food choices at sea.<br><br>Changes in ship construction and propulsion have compelled changes in food at sea, and Spalding&#x2019;s book explores these changes in cargo ships, passenger ships, warships, and other types over the centuries in fascinating depth of detail.

(<i>Library Journal, Starred Review</i>)<br><br>Spalding, a scholar and sailor who has worked and cooked at sea, posits in the introduction to this academic work on how food was prepared on ships from the Viking age to the Titanic. The slender volume manages to cover the entirety of human history at sea. Spalding&#x2019;s tone is dry, but readers hungry for eccentric facts about cooking and eating in the ocean may delight in its specificities: a chart detailing rations of pork and beans and bully beef during the Civil War, the Gala Dinner Menu from aboard the S.S. United States (Foie Gras in aspic, Kangaroo Tail soup), and how canned salmon came to replace salt cod with the advent of canning. The book&#x2019;s standout section, however, is the chapter devoted to immigrant and slave ships, which describes meals given to slaves in the Middle Passage, opening up a larger discussion of conditions and life on these ships. Immigrant families were forced to share a stove, each family expected 'to prepare its own food.' The book concludes with several as sample recipes throughout time B&amp;W Photo.

Foss is a culinary historian whose areas of expertise are beverages and the history of immigrant contributions to California cuisine, while Spalding is a consultant for historic programs, a maritime historian, and a musician. Each well-researched book follows a chronological sequence that clearly shows how the food prepared and served on watercraft, aircraft, and spacecraft developed in conjunction with the vehicles themselves, as well as the advancement of nutrition studies, technology, military science, and the tourism industry. . . .Food at Sea includes a section of authentic shipboard recipes from ancient times to WW II that one could make at home.

Krauss, University Professor at Columbia University and an editor and cofounder of <i>October</i> magazine, is the author of <i>The Originality of the Avant-Garde and Other Modernist Myths</i> (1985), <i>The Optical Unconscious</i> (1993), <i>The Picasso Papers</i> (1999), and <i>Bachelors</i> (1999), all published by the MIT Press, and coauthor (with Yve-Alain Bois) of <i>Formless: A User's Guide</i> (Zone Books, 1997).One of the country's foremost critics and theorists, Krauss here offers a unique, scholarly look at Picasso's numerous styles, with some of the most fascinating analysis examining the juncture between them. In the first section, the book's title becomes a play on the materials from which Picasso constructed his cubist works. Krauss deconstructs many individual pieces in terms of background and foreground and grants the newspapers the role of dialog among subjects. What is most interesting and unique about the analysis is her convincing argument that the introduction of color into the cubist palette was the impetus for the artist's abandoning that style. Later she discusses Picasso's frequent borrowings?from Ingress and Cezanne, Seurat and even photography?the idea of synthesis, and the existence of a work as unique hybrid. Throughout, she critiques the innumerable previous writings on Picasso, and in the book's final section she offers a deeper look at a few titles and the purpose they serve in the making of the Modern master. Not a biography for Picasso novices, this is nonetheless accessible to informed lay readers and deserves a place in larger public as well as all academic collections.?Douglas McClemont, New York<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Hauntings and Poltergeists: A Ghost Hunter&#39;s Guide</h2><p>Explains the theories behind ghostly phenomena from the perspective of parapsychology.

Williams presents the story of a black, gay jazz musician imprisoned in Dachau who manages to survive by working as the band leader of a group of prisoners who play at a nearby club for SS officers. If there is an undiscovered aspect of the black experience, it will be found by Williams.Saturday, November 11, 1939 <p>Dieter Lange came up behind me this morning while I was cleaning the house before going to the canteen. Anna had gone shopping in Munich to getsome new clothes. "They almost got him!" Dieter Lange whispered, as though someone was hiding in the house. "Almost got him!" </p><p>"Got who? Who's they?" </p><p>His eyes were bright and he was all up in my face like when he's drunk andhe whispers, "Wie steht es?" How about it? "Hitler! They almost got Hitler, with a bomb in Munich, Thursday night!" </p><p>I snapped the dust out of my cloth. To me a miss was as good as a mile. I didn't know what all the fuss was about. "But who did it?" </p><p>"Some Red carpenter in Munich. They got him." </p><p>"But who else? You said they?" </p><p>"Just him, as far as I've heard. But it shows that people don't want war and they want to be rid of Hitler. So maybe the next time they'll get him,eh? And maybe that's not too far off." He walked around the room, his hands behind his back. "You know I'd let you go if we got out of this mess. I'd give you the money to get back home. I really would, Cleef." </p><p>"I'd sure appreciate that," I said, but it wouldn't happen. He knew it and I knew it. White people fulla shit, especially when they run a place like Dachau. He stopped walking right in front of me and held my dusting hand. </p><p>"What's the matter with you, Cleef?" He gave me a close look, as though he might find something in my face that he'd missed before. "You've been . . . nicht heir for over a month now. Are you sick?" I looked at him. I didn't know what he was talking about. I said, "What doyou mean?" He raised his arms and moved them slowly up and down like he was a bird on the wind. "You just got machen all the time, maybe like you had some cocaine?" I released my hand and went back to dusting. He watched me and said, "Achtsam, Cleef, bitte, Achtsam," then he went upstairs to his office. When I finished, I shouted to him that I was going to the canteen and left. Ididn't wait for him to answer. It was another Armistice Day, ha-ha-ha, to celebrate the war to end all wars, except the one that just began. Ta-ta, da-da, de-dum. . . . "Hey, Sunshine!!" I stopped and turned around. I'd passed through the Jourhaus gate. Sergeant Rekse, his Schaferhund straining at his leash, was shouting. I didn't know why. "What do you do, why do you skip like a little kid? Are you nuts, Pepperidge? You want to wind up in the Hartheim wagon like those other niggers went out of here this morning?" Skipping? I was skipping? I whipped off my cap. "No, sir." "I'll tell your mother on you!" he roared, laughing, rolling back on his heels. He rubbed my head for good luck. The shepherd he'd brought to heel snapped his head from me to Rekse and back again, its tongue hanging out. Would Rekse never forget that visit by Ruby Mae? "Get going, Pepperidge, and get those marbles out of your head. They're glass, you know, and can be broken." I thanked him and replaced my cap and walked quickly away, up the west- side path, into the stiff, cold wind. I lowered my chin to protect my throat even though the sun was shining. But would Pierre be gone? Would he have been one of those "niggers" on the wagon ride to Hartheim? We used to gather on this side of the camp to hear Hitler's speeches, which were broadcast over the loudspeakers hooked up across the moat on the ss side. </p><p>The moat is outside the wall on this side of the camp. Now there are walls with the electric fences on the top. I could see the rooftops of the factories, hear the banging and clanging of work going on inside them, the hum and screech of machinery. I was almost never on this side, but I could wonder now at just how much the prisoners had done since I first came. Down at the end of the camp, the sun was reflecting off the glass of the new greenhouse. Oh, Pierre. A group of prisoners pulled a wagon loaded with the dead from the Reviers and the morgue. Then I was at the northwest corner where the small north road bisects the smaller west path, where the gates lead to the inferno the dead don't feel. </p><p>Or if they do, they can't say so. The greenhouse stood before me; to its right was the garden, then a space where rabbits were raised, for ss Hasenpfever and for Luftwafe pilots' jackets. Then the disinfection hut where Pierre had worked. Above all this was the north watchtower with its sliding glass windows, its machine gun, and the guard with his rifle. I stood there with my pass at the ready to show any guard, and watched the prisoners wheeling barrows of rich black dirt from a huge pile into the greenhouse. The prisoners were all white, untouched by that soft, golden color that was Pierre's. My stomach began a slow, cold slide downward. I moved forward a few steps. Maybe the sun was shining too brightly, or the cutting wind was doing something to my eyesight. "Oh, Pierre," I whispered to myself. I looked at the pile of earth, then saw a shovel and a pair of blackened hands, disembodied parts, moving in a slow steady rhythm, filling a barrow. I walked to where I could see who the shoveler was. It was Pierre. He saw me and winked and smiled. I smiled back and felt the wind sharper on my face where it met the tears. I waved and turned away toward the 'Strasse. Why were my footsteps heavier than before? Would Pierre be in the next group to Hartheim? Would it be easier for me if he was, or even if he'd gone this morning? There would be no more "Suppose," no more worry. It would be over and done with. I felt I was walling up something inside me that no one could touch or reach from now on, that no one could hurt. Dieter Lange could be in me, but not in that place; Pierre could "Suppose" me, but never again would he be able to touch that place, because it was my sanctuary, my church, the grove where Loa Aizan, forever watchful, rested. I skipped up the 'Strasse humming. In answer to the smiles, the circles drawn on the sides of the heads, I muttered, "Fuck you. Fuck you."</p></p><h2>Piping Down the Valleys Wild</h2><p>The classic poetry treasury in a fresh new edition includes poems by Robert Frost, Karla Kushin, e.e. cummings, T.S. Elliot, W.B.

He has a PhD in early Tudor history from Clare College, Cambridge. Winter King is his first book.A brilliant debut ... this impressive book will certainly become the definitive study of our strangest, most mysterious, king -- Desmond Seward * BBC History Magazine * Stunning ... effortlessly vivid prose ... a revelation. [Penn&#39;s] focus is on the last, fear-filled decade of [Henry VII&#39;s] reign, but his sinuously coiling chapters seamlessly unfold the past as well as the present of his protagonists ... [He] has pulled off a rare feat: a brilliant and haunting evocation of the Tudor world, with irresistible echoes of the age of fear in which we now live -- Helen Castor * Telegraph * [A] brilliant mash-up of gothic horror and political biography ... a tour de force: both scholarly and a pleasure to read, covering the breadth of the European political scene, while providing the details that allow us to feel intimately the terror at home * Spectator * Remarkable ... Penn brilliantly recreates the sterile atmosphere suffocating Henry&#39;s England. His eye for time, circumstance and the telling anecdote is keen. Winter King offers us the fullest, deepest, most compelling insight into the warped psychology of the Tudor dynasty&#39;s founder to have appeared since Bacon wrote * Financial Times * [Thomas Penn] is a superb teller of a tale, a reveller in dodgy deeds, a keen observer of the febrile, dissimulating characters of court and embassy, and a splendid limner of the great jousts and entertainments of the age ... with a sharp eye for detail and adroit use of a gifted historical imagination, ... he lets us hear the creak of oars and the scratch of pens, as well as the tubercular king fighting for every breath ... Vigorous and thoroughly enjoyable * Economist * I feel like I&#39;ve been waiting to read this book a long time ... a fluent and compelling account ... The level of detail is fascinating and beautifully judged ... I think that, for the first time, a writer has made me feel what contemporaries felt as Henry VII&#39;s reign drew to an end; the relief, the hope, the sudden buoyancy -- Hilary Mantel, author of &#39;Wolf Hall&#39; Succeeds brilliantly ... [a] finely drawn portrait ... Penn&#39;s deft turn of phrase superbly re-creates the drama and personalities of the court -- Tracy Borman * Sunday Times * An exceptionally stylish literary debut. Henry VII may be the most unlikely person ever to have occupied the throne of England, and his biographers have rarely conveyed just what a weird man he was. Thomas Penn does this triumphantly, and in the process manages to place his subject in a vividly realised landscape. His book should be the first port of call for anyone trying to understand England&#39;s most flagrant usurper since William the Conqueror -- Diarmaid MacCulloch A definitive and accessible account of the reign of Henry VII that will alter our view not just of Henry, but of the country he dominated and corrupted, and of the dynasty he founded ... [Penn&#39;s] point is to show that this is not the &#34;merrie England&#34; of the Tudor myth, but a country forced under the rule of a new king, spied on and policed for any sign of disloyalty, and tyrannised by the use of ancient half-forgotten fines and taxes -- Philippa Gregory * Observer * [Penn] achieves the remarkable feat of making the reign of Henry VII seem more interesting than that of his son. Winter King is well titled: the fingers of the first Tudor king, in Penn&#39;s account of his final years, are icy to the touch, and probe into every nook and cranny of the kingdom ... gripping and unexpected -- Tom Holland * Guardian *</p><h2>Raising the Bar (High Hurdles #9)</h2><p>While rescuing Herndon and other horses from a burning barn, fifteen-year-old DJ suffers serious injuries but also finds that God has answered her prayer to overcome a life-long fear of fire</p><p><b>Lauraine Snelling</b> is an award winning author of over 30 books, both fiction and non fiction for adults and young adults.

Bolstered by a command of Arabic, a fair knowledge of Farsi, and an irrepressible drive that would characterize her more than five decades as a traveler and explorer, Stark spent most of the next four years in Iraq and Persia. Stark traveled alone throughout some of the wilder areas of the Middle East at a time when this area was gaining new worldwide importance. For Stark, risk-taking was the essence of a life worth living: while never hunting out danger for its own sake, she nevertheless viewed her travels as a way of expressing her freedom.

Its impressive architecture goes back 800 years, to its origins as a fortress guarding medieval Paris. In its contemporary incarnation, recently reconfigured and rebaptized "The Grand Louvre," it spreads over four levels and boasts more than 30,000 works of art; its galleries, shops, and offices occupy some 1.6 million square feet, of which some 645,000 are dedicated to exhibitions.<br> <br>Such daunting dimensions can make the museum feel like an endless labyrinth to uninitiated visitors. For them, <i>The Pocket Louvre</i> is a unique and essential resource, including:<br> <br>-A handy user's guide with information about access to the museum and its many services, from cafes to a post office to shops.<br>-Suggested itineraries for visits of varying lengths and for visitors with differing interests.<br>-A history of the Louvre and its architecture.<br>-A history of the collections.<br>-An illustrated catalog of 500 masterpieces, all in color, with useful brief commentaries.<br></p><p><b>Claude Mignot</b> is a professor of art history at the University of Tours, specializing in the history of Parisian art and architecture from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century.<br><b>An Array of Tours</b> <br> <br>The Louvre is its own world, and there are many different ways to experience it. The most serious approach is that adopted by methodical visitors, who systematically absorb the full range of the Louvre's holdings. The most original approach is the one preferred by independent-minded enthusiasts, who drop by for an hour or two just to visit a handful of favorite works, much as one might reread a favorite book. The most relaxed approach is that preferred by dilettantes, who wander haphazardly through the Louvre, taking their pleasures as they find them. The most expeditious (and exhausting) approach is the one preferred by tourists in a hurry, who can devote only half a day to the Louvre but want to see as many famous artworks as possible.<br> <br>In 1964 the rebellious young heroes of Jean-Luc Godard's film <i>Band of Outsiders</i> visited the Louvre in just three and a half minutes, galloping through the Grande Galerie in record time (fig. 2). It would be hard to top their speed. Even if you spent only a few seconds looking at each of the museum's roughly 30,000 works on view, over forty hours would be required&#x2014;an entire work week.<br> <br>Those settling in for an extended stay in Paris, and those who come to the city regularly, might want to visit the Louvre one department at a time, perhaps allotting one-half day for each&#x2014;or more, depending on personal interests and inclinations. Detailed itineraries for such visits, lasting about two hours each, can be found at the head of each of the departmental chapters, which begin on page 73. For those with less time, we propose the following tours.<br> <br> <b>Introductory Tour A (three hours)</b> <br> <br>From the Hall of the Pyramid, enter the Sully wing and proceed to the Medieval Louvre exhibit, where you can see the excavated stone walls of its moat and round keep. After visiting the medieval artifacts in the Salle Saint-Louis, walk up the Henri II stair to the ground floor. This will take you to what was the ballroom in King Henri II's "new Louvre"; it is also known as the Salle des Cariatides (Hall of the Caryatids; room 17), named after the beautiful female figures by the French sculptor Jean Goujon that support the platform where musicians once played (fig. 7).<br> <br>You may want to spend some time with the Roman statues now on view in this room (<i>Diana the Huntress</i>, plate 103; <i>Hanging Marsyas</i>, plate 105) before passing through the area formerly occupied by the royal "tribunal," or podium, at the end of the ballroom. From there you will see, on the left, the rooms containing Greco-Roman sculpture (rooms 7&#x2013;16), handsomely decorated in red marble that sets off the white marble sculpture (room 12: <i>Venus de Milo</i>, plate 100).<br> <br>If you want to save some extra time for French and northern European painting later in the tour, turn right from the Salle des Cariatides, toward the Denon wing, and go straight down the corridor to the Victory of Samothrace stair; if you go up and then turn right at the landing where <i>The Winged Victory</i>(plate 138) is displayed, the stair will take you directly up to the Italian painting galleries on the first floor.<br> <br>Otherwise, behind the <i>Venus de Milo</i> and adjacent to room 13 you will find a stairway leading down to the Crypt of the Sphinx (room 1), which introduces the rooms containing Egyptian antiquities (reached by walking up one flight). You can shorten this part of the tour by walking through to room 11 and then up the south stair of the Colonnade wing (which is sometimes closed off), in which case you will skip most of the ground-floor thematic installation of Egyptian antiquities and concentrate instead on the chronological one on the floor above. (If you want a full tour of the Egyptian collection, consult pages 73&#x2013;115.) If you prefer, you can stay on the ground floor and take in all of the thematic display&#x2014;including the Temple Room (room 12)&#x2014;which concludes at the north stair of the Colonnade wing.<br> <br>In addition to offering a fine view of the Cour Carree from room 23, the first-floor Egyptian galleries contain the royal bedchambers of Henri II and Louis XIV (rooms 25 and 26), which boast superb wood paneling. From the south stair of the Colonnade wing (which offers a good view of the Pont Neuf), enter the Musee Charles X (starting with room 27), which occupies the first floor of the south side of the Cour Carree. Below its beautiful painted ceilings celebrating the discovery of Egyptian art, Herculaneum and Pompeii, and Italian Renaissance art, you will find the final galleries of the Egyptian department (rooms 27&#x2013;30) as well as a collection of Roman ceramics (rooms 38&#x2013;35). If you chose to shorten the Egyptian antiquities part of your tour by skipping the thematic installation, you may want to use some of the time you saved to examine the splendid collection of Greek vases in the series of galleries overlooking the Seine, known collectively as the Galerie Campana (rooms 44&#x2013;47).<br> <br>Proceeding straight ahead to the Salle des Sept-Cheminees (Hall of Seven Chimneys; room 74) and the Apollo Rotunda (and passing by the entrance to the Apollo Gallery, room 66, which holds royal jewelry, silverware, and crowns), you will arrive at the Victory of Samothrace stair.<br> <br>Turn left, toward the <i>Victory</i>, and pass through the Percier and Fontaine rooms (rooms 1 and 2) to the Salon Carre (room 3) and the adjacent Grande Galerie (rooms 5, 8, and 12; fig. 3). You are now in the heart of the original Musee du Louvre, where Italian paintings are on view. A third of the way down the Grande Galerie is a door to the right that leads to the Salle des Etats (Hall of State; room 6), which contains masterpieces by Raphael, Titian, and Veronese as well as the <i>Mona Lisa</i> (plate 314) by Leonardo da Vinci. (A departmental tour of the Italian paintings is offered on pages 331&#x2013;87.)<br> <br>You can return to the Grande Galerie and walk all the way to the Spanish paintings at the very end, where you will find an exit (Portes des Lions) that puts you near the Tuileries gardens. Or, you can continue only as far as the paintings by Caravaggio, near which you will find a door leading to rooms 9&#x2013;11, which contain Italian "cartoons" (full-scale working drawings) and, beyond, to the Mollien stair and the large galleries of nineteenth-century French paintings (rooms 77 and 75). You can take a look at these now (or come back later), before taking the Mollien stair down to the ground floor. There you will arrive in the Italian sculpture hall, which contains works by Michelangelo (<i>Slaves</i>, plate 412) and Antonion Canova (<i>Cupid and Psyche</i>, plate 415). After reaching the Denon vestibule, you can either go straight ahead and pay a quick visit to the large Galeria Daru (room B) beyond, which contains beautiful Roman sculpture from the Borgese collection, or you can turn right and proceed directly to the Hall of the Pyramid via the escalators in the Salle du Manege (former site of the imperial riding school).<br> <br>This brief introductory tour does not give you time to see the French sculpture collection, the Oriental antiquities, the objets d'art galleries, or most of the French paintings (unless, of course, you opted to skip the Egyptian galleries, in which case you may have time for them now). If you regret having missed them, take the Classic Tour C or the departmental tours.<br></p><h2>The Spirit Well (Bright Empires - Book 3)</h2><p><p><strong>The Search for the Map&#x2014;and the secret behind its cryptic code&#x2014;intensifies in a quest across time, space, and multiple realities.</strong></p><p>But what if the true treasure isn&#x2019;t the map at all . . . what if the map marks something far greater?

It&#x2019;s the seventh game of the World Series, bottom of the ninth inning, Cubs against the Yankees, and the bases are loaded. The score is 2&#x2013;1, Cubs, but the Yanks are threatening. (The Yankees haven&#x2019;t been a great team for years, but they&#x2019;re still satisfying to beat in dreams.) Wrigley Field boils and churns with cheers, claps, and fans on their feet waving &#x201c;W&#x201d; flags.</p><p>The green field glows. The ivy on the walls gleams under the bright white light and rustles in the crisp lake wind.</p><p>The Cubs are an out away from winning a World Series, against all odds. But they&#x2019;ve run out of pitchers. Fergie Jenkins, Kerry Wood, Jon Lester, Kyle Hendricks, Greg Maddux, and Mordecai &#x201c;Three Finger&#x201d; Brown (an improbable all-era roster of Cubs all-stars) have all thrown brilliantly. But the bullpen is almost bare. The manager (a gray-haired, knob-nosed fusion of Joe Maddon, Charlie Grimm, and Joe McCarthy) is downcast and flummoxed. Then a light goes on in his eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a crazy idea, I know,&#x201d; he tells his coaches. &#x201c;But I got a feeling . . .&#x201d;</p><p>I hear my name crackle over the old tin speakers and echo over the slatted green seats and scuffed concrete stairs. Astonishment rolls through the crowd. The announcers (who sound like Joe Buck and Bob Costas) are stupefied, if not quite speechless. &#x201c;A move no one could have predicted . . .&#x201d; I take slow, deliberate strides over the electrified green grass and look down to see my arms in white sleeves with Cubby blue stripes.</p><p>I reach the mound. Some of the astounded hubbub dies. The catcher (all grit and spit, a grizzled combination of Randy Hundley, Gabby Hartnett, and David Ross) hands me the ball. &#x201c;No need to go over signs,&#x201d; he says through a chaw and a grin. He knows I have just one pitch: a fat, slow dodo of a throw that catches the wind like a candy wrapper, darts, floats, curves, and is preposterously difficult to hit.</p><p>My catcher returns to crouch behind home plate. In the broadcast booth, Joe and Bob sputter to explain this stunning turn. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a fan. But he knows a lot about the franchise, and he&#x2019;s been practicing his pitch at the gym. And the Cubs must have seen something they liked, because here he is . . .&#x201d;</p><p>The Yankee batter glowers and spits. He&#x2019;s not Derek, Gehrig, or the Mick, but some malevolent, swearing, gob- spitting, steel-bearded, pinstriped brute. In fact, let&#x2019;s call him the Brute. He tells our catcher, &#x201c;Look what the cat dragged to the mound.&#x201d; Then the Brute glares at me: &#x201c;Time for batting practice, rook.&#x201d;</p><p>I take a deep breath. The seats at Wrigley roil with 43,000 Cubs fans who take a sudden deep breath at the same time and fall silent. I look to my right to see the all-star Cubs spirits of Kris Bryant and Ron Santo dance on their toes at third, and Addison Russell, Ernie Banks, and Joe Tinker at short. I glance to my right: Javy B�ez and Ryno Sandberg are on patrol at second base, while Anthony Rizzo and Mark Grace spit and pound the pockets of their gloves at first.</p><p>I look in to my catcher. I draw back my arms. I twist slightly to put my power into the psoas muscle (as my yoga trainer has taught me) and bring my right arm through above my shoulder, snapping off the throw with my right hand.</p><p>All action seems to slow. I see the ball hang in the night air, snag the lake wind, then float and weave, its red seams whirling. The Brute spits, then swings mightily. But the fat of his bat misses by six inches, and I hear&#x2014;43,000 fans hear&#x2014;his swing whiff the air like a tree cracking and falling.</p><p>&#x201c;Stee-rike!&#x201d;</p><p>The Brute steps back to spit and swear. He wipes his huge, grimy hands across his pinstripes and yells out to the mound, &#x201c;Try that again, meat. I got your number now.&#x201d;</p><p>My wife, Caroline, our daughters, Elise and Paulina, our dog, and my late mother sit together in grandstand seats along the third base line. All but our dog, Daisy, have their heads lowered in anticipated embarrassment. (Daisy believes.) My mother tells all nearby, &#x201c;Well, you know, darlings, all that writing stuff came later. Pitching for the Cubs is really what he&#x2019;s always wanted to do. I just hope . . .&#x201d; </p><p>I shake off my catcher&#x2019;s sign, but it&#x2019;s an act; I&#x2019;ll throw the same pitch, and hope he won&#x2019;t see it coming. I rear back, thrust forward, and let the ball go from the tips of my fingers. It bobs and weaves as capriciously as the flight of a firefly. The Brute holds back for an instant, addled and confused, then tries to punch the ball with his bat.</p><p>The gesture looks desperate and pathetic. The Brute misses by a foot. The roar of the crowd is so loud I can only read the lips of the ump as he bellows, &#x201c;Stee-rike two!&#x201d;</p><p>Up in the booth, Bob and Joe agree as one. &#x201c;Nothing quite like this has ever been seen in baseball history. The Chicago Cubs&#x2014;historically one of the most beloved, but easily the most cursed, hexed, and jinxed franchise in sports history&#x2014;are a strike away from winning the World Series and have bet it all on a longtime fan with a freakishly effective pitch. How amazing! How utterly . . . Cub-like!&#x201d;</p><p>Ernie Banks trots in from short to hold up a single, slim finger. &#x201c;Just one more, Scooter, one more!&#x201d; Ron Santo and Kris Bryant pound their gloves at third, while Javy and Ryno draw their toes around second base. I shake off a first sign. Then a second, then a third. My catcher, who knows this plan, gives his plump brown glove a last thump and holds it over the heart of the plate. I rear back and rock my psoas. But this time, I don&#x2019;t snap off a last floater of a pitch&#x2014;what the Brute, the NSA, the KGB, MI5, and thousands in the stands and sixty million people tuned in at home expect. Instead, I bring my right arm through with the power of a rocket burst. The seams on the ball whizz and whirr into a blinding blur.</p><p>The crowd inhales. The Brute rocks back on his heels, too astonished even to lift his bat from his shoulders.</p><p>The radar gun f lickers before it glows with three numerals: 101 mph. My fastball smacks the catcher&#x2019;s mitt like a crack of lightning. The Brute thumps his hitless bat on the ground in defeat and frustration, where it leaves an angry gash the size of a canal. The ump cries, &#x201c;Strike three!&#x201d; Joe and Bob sputter, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe it! I can&#x2019;t believe it! Against all odds, and after more than a century . . .&#x201d; as Ernie, Ron, Ryno, Kris, Javy, Gabby, David, Fergie, Kyle, Jon, and Kerry pile all over me on the mound and a sea of Cubby blue fills the Friendly Confines of the greatest and greenest old brick ballpark, with her ivy-covered walls.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I am a Cubs fan. A husband and father, an American, a Chicagoan, and a Cubs fan. My politics, religion, and personal tastes change with whatever I learn from life. But being a Cubs fan is my nature, my heritage, and probably somewhere in my chromosomes.</p><p>If you prick me, I&#x2019;m quite sure I&#x2019;ll bleed Cubby blue.</p><p>I am in the news business, and try to keep myself apprised of the timeliest information about unrest, wars, finance, and affairs of state. But in the morning, I usually check the scores of Cubs games the moment my feet hit the floor.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve been blessed to see the Rose City of Petra, the Pink City of Jaipur, and the gracefully gushing fountains in the Place de la Concorde. But I still can&#x2019;t imagine a more beautiful place on earth than Wrigley Field, an ivied spot in a city setting of red brick against lakefront towers, especially on a soft August afternoon or crisp autumn night.</p><p>In the poetic opening words of <i>The Adventures of Augie March</i>, Saul Bellow defines the churning urban forces that have shaped his title character. I&#x2019;ve made a few adjustments:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>I am an American, north side Chicago born&#x2014;Chicago, that City of Big Shoulders&#x2014;and go at things as I have taught myself, free-style, and will make the record in my own way: first to knock, and historically often dead last in the National League. But a man&#x2019;s character is his fate, says Heraclitus, or as Moe Drabowsky, the Cubs pitcher, once put it, &#x201c;We came out of the dugout for opening day and saw a fan holding up a sign: &#x2018;Wait &#x2019;Til Next Year.&#x2019;&#x201d;</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To be devoted to the Chicago Cubs is to carry a torch of love that defies comparison. If rooting for the New York Yankees has been like rooting for Wal-Mart or Microsoft, what has it been like to root for the Cubs?</p><p>No metaphor for doom has ever improved on &#x201c;rooting for the Chicago Cubs.&#x201d;</p><p>People used to use compare the Cubs to the Hindenburg and the Titanic. But lives were actually lost in those failures; and besides, they sank just once. The Cubs couldn&#x2019;t win a World Series for 108 years.</p><p>During those decades, scientists split the atom in Chicago. Chicagoans built towers that scraped the sky. They improvised a new kind of comedy and transformed drama. Chicago writers pumped blood and muscle into literature. A Chicagoan walked on the moon. Chicagoans won Nobel Prizes in every category and invented Twinkies, Playboy magazine, and open-heart surgery. A Chicago man was elected president of the United States. (And actually, I&#x2019;m glad it was a White Sox fan. A Cubs fan with nuclear weapons? I imagine a mushroom cloud over Milwaukee. &#x201c;Oh, jeez, I thought that was to call for a pizza . . .&#x201d;)</p><p>But the Chicago Cubs still couldn&#x2019;t win the World Series. The Cubs have been the passion that confirms the triumph of hope over experience.</p><p>During the holiday season that followed the Cubs 2016 World Series win, a department store Santa Claus caught my eye with a white-gloved wave. He told his elves to let me approach his gilded chair. Santa reached below his throne, doffed his signature red stocking cap, and pulled on a Cubs hat.</p><p>&#x201c;I was a marine,&#x201d; Santa said. &#x201c;Went to &#x2019;Nam in sixty- nine. By August, Cubs were nine games up in the National League race,&#x201d; he continued, &#x201c;when they sent me out into the <i>shit</i>.&#x201d; Santa swore like a sailor, or anyhow like a marine. &#x201c;No Twitter-twat or e-mail in those days. We couldn&#x2019;t listen to that <i>Good Morning, Vietnam</i> guy either, or Charlie would find us. It was just us, Charlie, and the shit. By the time I got out of the jungle, it was December. I grabbed hold of the first guy I saw in the clear and shook him to pieces. &#x2018;Who the hell won the World Series?&#x2019; I asked. &#x2018;Who won?&#x2019; &#x2018;Oh, New York,&#x2019; he told me, and I said, &#x2018;Fucking Yankees, again, hey? Well, at least the Cubs finally got our chance.&#x2019; And this kid says, &#x2018;No sir. It was the New York Mets what won.&#x2019; And I shouted at him, &#x2018;The Mets? Fucking Mets, not even the Yanks? The goddamn Cubs had a nine-game lead! Did the team bus run off a cliff? Goddamn mother-loving ass- licking . . .&#x201d; Santa Cub grew exhaustively vulgar. &#x201c;&#x2018;I survived the<i> shit</i> just to hear that the Cubs <i>blew it</i> again?&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But this year . . .&#x201d; I told him, and Santa Cub jiggled his post-marine belly like a bowlful of jelly.</p><p>&#x201c;We earned the World Series 108 times over, hey? Our daddies and mammies and grandparents. Me and you.&#x201d;</p><p>A few more families had lined up to see him, and Santa switched back to his home-field red headgear. He adjusted his belly like an umpire&#x2019;s chest protector.</p><p>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, kids,&#x201d; he called over to the families. &#x201c;Step on over and say hello. Just chatting with this nice man. Santa and this man already got our present, didn&#x2019;t we, pallie? One we&#x2019;ve waited for a long time.&#x201d;</p><p>Santa really does have a twinkle in his eye.</p></p><h2>DK Eyewitness Barcelona and Catalonia (Travel Guide)</h2><p><b>An unbeatable guide to the buzzing city of Barcelona and the rural region of Catalonia, packed with photos and maps, insider tips, useful advice, and information.</b><br><br>Inspiring itineraries will help you discover the best things to do in Barcelona and Catalonia, from marveling at Barcelona Cathedral and Gaud�'s Sagrada Fam�lia and Park G�ell, to enjoying the sun on the Costa Brava and visiting the peaceful monasteries, such as Montserrat, in the hills of Catalonia.

It would have been a death skewer if not for the protective padded jackets they both wore.<br> <br>&#x201c;You should have accomplished that move three minutes ago,&#x201d; Poppie said, removing his mask so she could see the disapproval in his sharp blue eyes. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s distracting you today, Alana?&#x201d;<br> <br>Choices, she thought, three too many! Of course she was distracted. How could she concentrate on her lesson with so much on her mind? She had a life-changing decision to make. Of the three completely different directions she could take, each held its own special appeal, and she&#x2019;d run out of time. She was eighteen today. She couldn&#x2019;t put the decision off any longer.<br> <br>Her uncle was always so serious about these fencing lessons. Now was not the time to tell him of the dilemma she&#x2019;d been grappling with. But she did need to discuss it with him and would have done so much sooner if he hadn&#x2019;t seemed so preoccupied himself these last few months. It wasn&#x2019;t like him. When she&#x2019;d asked him if anything was wrong, he&#x2019;d fobbed her off with a smile and had denied it. That wasn&#x2019;t like him either.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d been able to hide her own preoccupation&#x2014;until today. But then he&#x2019;d taught her how to hide her emotions. He&#x2019;d taught her so many odd things over the years. . . .<br> <br>Her friends called her uncle eccentric. Imagine, his teaching her to use weapons! But she would always defend his right to be different. He wasn&#x2019;t an Englishman, after all. Her friends shouldn&#x2019;t try to compare him to one. She&#x2019;d even lost a few because of the wide-ranging education Poppie insisted she receive, but she didn&#x2019;t care. The snob who had moved in next door was a prime example of such narrow-mindedness. Alana had mentioned some of her recent studies and how fascinated she was with mathematics when she first met the girl.<br> <br>&#x201c;You sound like my older brother,&#x201d; the girl had said disdainfully. &#x201c;What do you and I need to know about the world? We just need to know how to run a household. Do you know how to do that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, but I can skewer an apple tossed in the air on the tip of my rapier before it hits the ground.&#x201d;<br> <br>They never did become friends. It was no loss. Alana had many others who marveled at her diverse education and just chocked it up to her being a foreigner like Poppie, even though she&#x2019;d lived in England her whole life and considered herself an Englishwoman.<br> <br>Poppie wasn&#x2019;t her uncle&#x2019;s real name but the name Alana had given him when she was a child because she liked pretending he was her father rather than her uncle. She was average in height herself, and he wasn&#x2019;t much taller than she was. And although he was in his mid-forties, he didn&#x2019;t have a line on his face yet to prove it, and his dark brown hair was just as dark as it had always been.<br> <br>Mathew Farmer was his real name, so English-sounding, which was funny, because his foreign accent was so pronounced. He was one of many European aristocrats who had fled the Continent during and immediately after the Napoleonic wars, to start new lives in England. He&#x2019;d brought her with him because he was the only family she had left.<br> <br>Her parents had died when she was an infant. Tragically, in a war they weren&#x2019;t even fighting in. They had tried to visit Alana&#x2019;s maternal grandmother in Prussia because they&#x2019;d received word that she was dying. They were shot on the way by overzealous French sympathizers who mistook them for enemies of Napol�on&#x2019;s. Poppie guessed it was because they were obviously aristocrats, and the simpleminded peons considered all aristocrats to be enemies of France&#x2019;s. He didn&#x2019;t know the details, and it made him sad to speculate. But he did tell her so much about her parents when she was young that she felt as if she had real, firsthand memories of them.<br> <br>As far back as she could remember, her father&#x2019;s brother had always been her guardian, her teacher, her companion, her friend. He was everything she could want in a father, and she loved him as one. What had happened to her parents was horrible, but she had always been grateful that Poppie was the one who ended up raising her.<br> <br>Because he was wealthy, her life with him was a mix of privilege and the unexpected. She&#x2019;d had a long stream of tutors, so many she&#x2019;d lost count. Each taught her something different and each stayed for only a few months. Lady Annette was the only one who had stayed with her longer. An impoverished young widow forced to seek employment, Lady Annette had been hired by Poppie to teach Alana all aspects of being a lady, then he&#x2019;d continued to employ her as a chaperone, so Annette had been part of the household for nine years now.<br> <br>Alana&#x2019;s days became even busier when she turned ten and her martial training began. Poppie himself taught her how to use various weapons. The day he took her into the room that had been cleared of furniture and whose walls were now lined with rapiers, daggers, and firearms, she recalled something he&#x2019;d told her when she was younger and probably thought she wouldn&#x2019;t remember: &#x201c;I used to kill people. I don&#x2019;t anymore.&#x201d;<br> <br>She&#x2019;d known he&#x2019;d fought in the wars that Napol�on had instigated all over the Continent, the same wars he&#x2019;d come to England to escape, but that had been an odd way to refer to it. That day he&#x2019;d put the rapier in her hand, she&#x2019;d asked him, &#x201c;This is the weapon you killed with?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, but I trained myself to use all weapons, and this one offers the most exercise and requires the greatest dexterity, quickness, agility, and cunning, so training in its use has more than one benefit. But for you in particular, it will teach you to avoid grappling, which a man will most definitely attempt with you, thinking he can subdue you with his superior strength. So it will teach you to keep your distance no matter the weapon at hand.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But I will probably never be required to use it to defend myself?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, you won&#x2019;t carry a rapier to defend yourself. You will master the pistol for that.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sword fighting was simply a form of exercise to keep her fit. She understood that. She came to look forward to those practice sessions with Poppie as the highlight of her days. Unlike some of her other tutors, he was always calm and patient with her.<br> <br>Annette had risked losing her job when she&#x2019;d confronted Poppie about the new turn Alana&#x2019;s studies were taking. Alana had caught the tail end of that argument as she passed Poppie&#x2019;s study one day. &#x201c;Weapons? Good Lord, she&#x2019;s already too bold and opinionated, and now you put weapons in her hands? You&#x2019;ve given her a man&#x2019;s education. How do you expect me to counter that at this late date?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t expect you to counter it,&#x201d; Poppie had calmly replied. &#x201c;I expect you to teach her that she will have choices in how to deal with people. What you criticize as being too bold, manly even, will only be a benefit to her.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s not ladylike, not in the least.&#x201d;<br> <br>Poppie had chuckled. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s enough that you teach her manners and all the other things a lady should know. Keep in mind, you aren&#x2019;t creating a lady out of thin air. She&#x2019;s already a lady of the highest caliber. And I&#x2019;m not going to deny her a real education just because she&#x2019;s a woman.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But she questions everything I&#x2019;m trying to teach her, just as a man would.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad to hear it. I taught her to be thorough, even meticulous, in the analysis of any given situation. If anything strikes her as odd, she&#x2019;s not to shrug it off, but to find out why. I have confidence you will persevere without disrupting what she&#x2019;s already been taught.&#x201d;<br> <br>With that remark sounding like a warning, the discussion had ended right then and there.<br> <br>Now, Alana stepped back from Poppie and moved to the wall to put her weapon away. It was time for her to tell him what was distracting her. She couldn&#x2019;t put it off any longer.<br> <br>&#x201c;I have some unexpected decisions to make, Poppie. Can we discuss them tonight at dinner, or as soon as I get back from the orphanage?&#x201d;<br> <br>She knew he would be frowning now. He might not have forbade it, but he didn&#x2019;t like her going to the orphanage even though it was his orphanage. When she&#x2019;d found out last year about this institution he had established soon after they&#x2019;d arrived in London and had been supporting ever since, she&#x2019;d been incredulous. She didn&#x2019;t know why he&#x2019;d never mentioned it to her. Because her later education had leaned toward turning her into a lady? And ladies shouldn&#x2019;t associate with urchins from the slums? But his explanation had been simple.<br> <br>&#x201c;I was given a new life here, a second chance. I felt unworthy of it. I needed to give something back, to try to give others the same chance I was given for a new life. It took me a few years to figure out that the people most in need of my help were the most hopeless, the homeless street urchins.&#x201d;<br> <br>A worthy cause. Could she do any less? It had seemed so natural for her to decide to teach there. Her education had included so many different subjects and skills that she was far more qualified than any of the other teachers. She loved doing it. Whether she should continue to teach at the orphanage was one of the decisions she had to confront because teaching wasn&#x2019;t at all compatible with the other two paths she could choose.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve made a decision as well,&#x201d; he said, standing behind her. &#x201c;I never thought this day would be so momentous for you, but I cannot put off this matter any longer. Come to my office now.&#x201d;<br> <br>Good Lord, was she going to have even more choices set before her? She swung around abruptly and saw how uneasy he looked. He couldn&#x2019;t see the apprehension in her gray-blue eyes through the fencing mask she hadn&#x2019;t yet removed. Momentous? That sounded so much more important than her own dilemma.<br> <br>He turned to the door, expecting her to follow him. &#x201c;Wait, Poppie. The children have planned a birthday party for me. They&#x2019;ll be disappointed if I don&#x2019;t visit the orphanage today.&#x201d;<br> <br>He didn&#x2019;t immediately answer. He had to think about it? When he cared for those children as much as she did?<br> <br>He finally said, &#x201c;Very well, but don&#x2019;t be long.&#x201d;<br> <br>He left the room before he could see her hesitant nod. By rote she removed her mask, the padded jacket, and the tie that bound back her long black hair. Now she was filled with dread.</p><h2>Decorative Origami Boxes (Dover Origami Papercraft)</h2><p>Forget the giftwrap &#x2014; these&nbsp;unique boxes are perfect for gift-giving.

Beyond the names you'll immediately recognize (Pollack, DeKooning, Gorky, etc.) this alphabetically arranged set takes a fair and complete look, including commentary from the artists that helps to illuminate an often moody and pensive style. We like Kline's ideas on size and space and also when DeKooning says, "spiritually I am wherever my spirit allows me to be." American Abstract should be a fixture in libraries and the homes of the lovers of the form. --Writers Notes Magazine Book Editor<br> --Writers Notes Magazine, 2005<br><br>Illuminating View Through a Very Special Window.The window is the eye of a devoted scholar who rips through the red-tape and pitfalls of dealing with artist's estates, galleries and the art world in general! It takes guts and grit to create a second book of the underknown Abstract Expressionists. This volume centers on the Abstract Expressionists of the 1950's, throughout the USA. It adds 80+ artists to the first tour d'force titled, New York School Abstract Expressionists: Artists Choice by Artists. Fortunately, many of the superb African American painters are represented. Ms. Herskovic mentions in her introduction that there were NO painters of African descent in the 9th Street show or any of the artist's annuals. This shocking revelation shows just how NEW integration really is. Norman Lewis, Hale Woodruff, Alma Thomas, Charles Alston, and Edward Clark are a fine quintet whose work shines through the pages of this fantastically researched volume of exceptional quality. As far as I am concerned, they are American Abstract Expressionists who just happen to be of color. Underknown Abstract Expressionist artists in the 1950's had a tough time getting known. After all, there were the meteors with names like Pollock, Rothko, Still, and de Kooning, to easily overshadow you. Not necessarily in quality, but in fame. Painters of African descent naturally had a very difficult time. America might have been avant-garde about this new art but was backward regarding equality of its people.<br>The West Coast is also represented by some fine painters. Elmer Bischoff, Budd Dixon, Hans Burkhardt, Richard Diebenkorn, Ernest Briggs, Hassel Smith, Richards Ruben, John Saccaro, and Robert McChesney are just a few from the West Coast!<br><br>Curators take note: This, the 2nd volume concerning the Abstract Expressionists in America, is a must have. Both volumes have to be included in your museum's library. These volumes are a researcher's dream! Plus, what great exhibitions are possible!<br><br>The size and quality of the reproductions are excellent. The book has the same 12 1/2 x 9 1/2" format as the first volume. This time, the dust jacket is gold, in nice contrast to the first volume's silver cover. There are 88 artists represented, and each has an artist's statement which is so important. The statements back-up their precious works. Listed opposite the artist's two large examples, are biographies, where the artist studied or taught, Solo Exhibitions as well as Group shows. A nice touch are the quasi-tributes to two important Fathers of Modern Art and Abstract Expressionism; There are writings by Kandinsky which are very "today", and there is an homage to Arshile Gorky, possibly the most revered American artist before Pollock(according to painters of the NY School).<br><br>This scientifically researched 372 page volume will surely be the barometer that all future studies will use. --Amazon.com<br><br>OUTSTANDING ACADEMIC TITLE ~CHOICE, 2003<br>"This excellent publication builds on the earlier publication.

In the first, the youngster is swept away by the splendors of spring. As he walks with his mother through blossom-filled meadows, he reassures her: "It's a long time that I'll love you/And if I seem to stray/It's only that I'm watching/The flowers bloom in May." In "Green Song," he takes a pail and shovel to explore a field of wildflowers where "-little things creep/In their green grass forests deep/Deep in their long-stemmed world." On a wet autumn day, the little bear ventures out with a bright yellow umbrella and listens to the rhythmic songs of the wind and the rain. The final selection, "Snow Song," has a calming, quiet pace that is well suited to the subject and makes a fitting end piece ("Snow snow/Slow slow/In the soft fall of the snow/The little boats go"). The poems use simple language, gentle repetition, familiar images, and appealing rhythms that will capture the attention and imaginations of young listeners. Varying from smaller vignettes to full- and double-page spreads, the gouache paintings tie the poems together nicely by creating a strong visual story line. The outdoor scenes are lush and inviting, and show each of the seasons at its best. Jeffers does a wonderful job of expressing the little bear's relationship with his mother and the excitement that he feels with each new experience.

It is that legend Martin hopes to discover when he embarks on a perilous journey to the northland shore, where his father abandoned him as a child. There, within the carcass of a great red ship he uncovers what he has been searching for: the story of the evil Pirate stoat, Vilu Daskar, and the valiant mousewarrior who pursued him relentlessly over the high seas, seeking to destroy Vilu at all costs, even if it meant deserting his only son.

Support from Hepburn clearly helped Maychick (Meryl Streep, 1984) straighten out the actress's background: noble Dutch lineage; early years in the Netherlands under the Nazis; Resistance activities; dysfunctional family; first inroads of her eating disorder; misfire as a dancer; first films in Britain, and so on. But Maychick got less help on the real dirt, such as Hepburn's affair with married William Holden (``the love of her life''), whom she dumped when he said he'd had an irreversible vasectomy and couldn't have children. A chubby child with an addiction to chocolate, Hepburn turned off all interest in food during the war years, especially when driven by the Nazis into hiding alone for a month in a cellar, where she created a purposeful distaste for what she couldn't have. She hit it big simultaneously on Broadway-- having been discovered by Colette herself to play Gigi--and in Hollywood, winning on the same night an Oscar and a British Film Institute citation as best actress (both for Roman Holiday). A Tony (for Giradoux's Ondine) and a cover story in Time soon followed-- but few fans knew that Hepburn had little background in Hollywood films, or that her gamin innocence was the real thing. (Asked how he liked ``working with that dream girl'' in Sabrina, Bogart replied, ``She's okay, if you like to do 36 takes.'') Hepburn's marriage to lesser star Mel Ferrer drained her, as did some miscarriages, though a son finally came. She died of colon cancer right after visiting Somalia for UNICEF. Hepburn lends a gripping spine to Maychick's styleless but serviceable effort. (Sixteen pages of b&amp;w photographs) (First serial to Cosmopolitan) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>It would be nice to think that anyone as lovely as Audrey Hepburn would have lived a happy, lovely life as well, but this engaging biography, written with the late Hepburn's assistance, paints a different picture. Born of an English-Irish father, who became a Nazi sympathizer during World War II, and a Dutch noblewoman, who was a leader in the Dutch Resistance, the young Audrey spent the war years spying and starving, reduced at one point to eating tulip bulbs. This early deprivation contributed to her lifelong problem with food; Hepburn, who often refused to eat in times of stress, would be considered an anorexic by today's standards. Her love life was not much happier, with two failed marriages, the first to actor Mel Ferrer. But she had her children and her career--and, eventually, a companion, Robert Wolders. She also had her work with UNICEF, which became a highlight of her life. Maychick pads her narrative a bit by giving the plots of Hepburn's movies more than their share of attention, but, along with learning about the actress' real-life tragedies, Audrey's legion of fans won't mind being reminded of her magical moments on the screen. <i>Ilene Cooper</i></p><h2>Walking in the Footsteps of Jesus: A Journey Through the Lands and Lessons of Christ</h2><p>Imagine following Jesus along the road, listening in on his conversations and gleaning from the lessons He taught in the holy places He traveled.

By retracing the windswept roads Jesus took during His earthly life and ministry, you will encounter Him in a fresh and vital way and grow to a greater understanding of His will for your life.<b>Wayne Stiles</b> is the executive vice president for Insight for Living and a full-time husband and father.

His first Austin-Healey Sprite, a 1959 Mk1, was bought from a work colleague in 1969. After considerable repair work, it was sold just nine months later &#x2013; an action that was soon regretted. The next Sprite came along in 1976, followed by several other Sprites and Midgets. Terry still owns and drives a 1960 Sprite purchased in 1979, and a 1968 Sprite MkIV purchased in 1984. This interest in the marque led Terry, along with another work colleague, to form the Midget and Sprite Club in 1983 when these cars were at their lowest ebb. Since then, Terry has been a technical consultant for the club, writing many articles for the club magazine, forming the Sprite and Midget register, and helping owners with a wide variety of problems. Terry&#x2019;s first book, <i>Original Sprite and Midget</i>, was published in 1994, and is regarded as the definitive work on these cars.

A mosaic of 48 short chapters&#x2015;each recalling a specific episode from one of his many visits there (Brodsky spent his winters in Venice for nearly 20 years)&#x2015;<i>Watermark</i> associatively and brilliantly evokes one city's architectural and atmospheric character. In doing so, the book also reveals a subject&#x2015;and an author&#x2015;readers have never before seen.</p></p><p><p><b>Joseph Brodsky</b> (1940-96) came to the United States in 1972, an involuntary exile from the Soviet Union. He received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1987 and served as Poet Laureate of the United States in 1991 and 1992.</p><p>&#x201c;We read <i>Watermark</i> enraptured by its gallant attempt to distill a precious meaning from life's experience--to make a spot on a globe a window into universal circumstance, and to fashion of one's personal chronic tourism a crystal whose factes reflect an entire life, with exile and ill health glinting at the edges of planes whose direct glare is sheer beauty.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>John Updike, The New Yorker</i></p><p>&#x201c;Praising Venice and its architecture as a triumph of the visual, the Nobel laureate uses his visits there as a touchstone to meditate on life's unpredictability, and on the appetite for beauty, death, myth, and modern art . . . In his wayward forays amid canals, streets, and cathedrals barnacled with saints, the eternal Venice shimmers through the fog, battered yet resplendent.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;Brodsky's description of his 'version of Paradise' has all the vividness and associative brilliance of a lyric poem . . . <i>Watermark</i> is a gracefully idiosyncratic work, one that obliquely mingles the author's own self-portrait with that of 'this Penelope of a city, weaving her patterns by day and undoing them by night, with no Ulysses in sight. Only the sea.'&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>James Marcus, The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;[This is a] short prose-exercise by Nobelist Brodsky about Venice, his many wintertime trips there, and [the city's] enchantment and ironies and visual splendors. Brodsky has piquant ideas about space and time (see his <i>Less Than One</i>) that lend interesting angles to his Venice-for-visitors: ideas about water, light, and brick ('an alternative order of flesh, not raw of course, but scarlet and made up of small, identical cells. Yet another of the species' self-portraits at the elemental level, be it a wall or a chimney'). He finds himself one evening in the company of Olga Rudge, Ezra Pound's companion, which engenders a wonderfully European assessment of Pound: 'For someone with such a long record of residence in Italy, it was odd that he hadn't recognized that beauty can't be targeted, that it is always a by-product of other, often very ordinary pursuits.' Brodsky writes poetically of winter light: 'And the city lingers in it, savoring its touch, the caress of the infinity whence it came. An object, after all, is what makes infinity private.' When he's setting up to make aphorisms like this, Brodsky sails along.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p></p><h2>The Complete Plain Words</h2><p>Covers letter writing, diction, correctness of vocabulary, prepositions, pronouns, verbs, punctuation and usage trends</p><p>Sir Ernest Gowers was born in 1880 and served in a number of illustrious occupations.

First published in the 1920&#39;s, The Prophet is perhaps the most famous work of religious fiction of the twentieth century, and has sold millions of copies in more than twenty languages. Gibran&#39;s Prophet speaks of many things central to daily life: love, marriage, death, beauty, passion, eating, work and play. The spiritual message he imparts, of finding divinity through love, blends eastern mysticism, religious faith and philosophy with simple advice. The Prophet became the bible of 1960s culture and was credited with founding the New Age movement, yet it still continues to inspire people around the world today. This edition is illustrated with Gibran&#39;s famous visionary paintings. Kahlil Gibran (1883-1931) was a poet, philosopher and artist, who stands among the most important Arabic language authors of the early twentieth century. Born in Lebanon, he spent the last twenty years of his life in the United States, where for many years he was the leader of a Lebansese writing circle in New York. He is the author of numerous volumes, including The Garden of the Prophet, The Storm, The Beloved: Reflections on the Path of the Heart, The Vision, Reflections on the Way of the Soul, and Spirit Brides. If you enjoyed The Prophet, you might like Herman Hesse&#39;s Siddhartha, also available in Penguin Modern Classics. &#39;His work goes on from generation to generation&#39; Daily Mail &#39;To read it was to transcend ordinary levels of perception, to become aware ... of a more intense level of being&#39; Independent</p><p>In a distant, timeless place, a mysterious prophet walks the sands. At the moment of his departure, he wishes to offer the people gifts but possesses nothing. The people gather round, each asks a question of the heart, and the man's wisdom is his gift. It is Gibran's gift to us, as well, for Gibran's prophet is rivaled in his wisdom only by the founders of the world's great religions. On the most basic topics--marriage, children, friendship, work, pleasure--his words have a power and lucidity that in another era would surely have provoked the description "divinely inspired." Free of dogma, free of power structures and metaphysics, consider these poetic, moving aphorisms a 20th-century supplement to all sacred traditions--as millions of other readers already have. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>1 cassette / 90 minutes<br><b>Unabridged</b><p><b>The Prophet</b> is Kahlil Gibran's masterpiece, his most celebrated statement about the truths of the human experience.</p><p>Gibran considered <i>The Prophet</i> to be his greatest achievement.

Blackwood covers the pilgrimage from its planning stages through the pioneers' final destinations. Numerous diary excerpts tell of an unmerciful life on the trail where disease caused 9 out of every 10 emigrants' deaths and virtually every family suffered the loss of a child. The text details how the travelers "came to grief" and "what they found to enjoy." Interestingly enough, many of them thought the Indians more of a nuisance than a threat. Blackwood reports on resourceful individuals who created roadside telegraphs by carving and painting messages for fellow travelers on rocks and bones near the trail; one young couple managed to keep their romance a secret from disapproving fathers with this method. Inserts, maps, and black-and-white reproductions effectively augment the narrative.

He spent several hours in the cold Mediterranean waters holding onto what he thinks was a part of a hatch. He was picked up by the U.S.S. Pioneer as described in the book. I don&#39;t think there was a day he didn&#39;t think about it. It permanently affected his whole life; but most people never realized it. He passed away in April, 2013 at the age of 95. He was a great father and one the most honorable men on the face of the earth. --By Michael Wilde</p><h2>Full Moon</h2><p>Full Moon is a photographic journey to the Moon and back, drawn from NASA&#39;s 32,000 pictures from the Apollo missions. For the first time NASA has allowed 900 of the &#39;master&#39; negatives and transparencies to be taken offsite for electronic scanning so as to produce the sharpest images of space that we have ever seen. From this selection of &#39;master&#39; photographs Michael Light has distilled a single composite journey beginning with the launch, followed by a walk in space, an orbit of the Moon, a lunar landing and exploration and a return to Earth with an orbit and splash-down. Five enormous gatefold panoramas show the extraordinary lunar landscape. These photographs reveal not only the hardware of lunar exploration in exquisite detail but also the profound aesthetics of space in what could be described as the ultimate landscape photography. The reader is encouraged to view these pictures as more than a spectacle. You start to experience them with a sense of the accompanying disorientation and excitement that the astronaurs themselves would have felt. Full Moon was originally published in 1999 to mark the thirtieth anniversary of the first landing on the Moon. It was a milestone publication for the millennium, greeted with acclaim worldwide and published in eight countries. This new compact edition preserves all the superb quality of reproduction which was so evident in the original and makes this extraordinary work available to a still wider audience.</p><p>Michael Light is an artist and photographer based in San Francisco.&#39;A masterpiece - the kind of work that elicited a gasp from me with almost every turn of the page.&#39; Tom Hanks; &#39;Full Moon is the closest approximation of the real thing that I&#39;ve seen since being there.&#39; David R. Scott, Commander, Appolo 15</p><h2>Legion of Super-Heroes: Teenage Revolution</h2><p>In this new incarnation of the 1960s comic strip, a thirty-first century group of teenagers rebel against their parents and their super-utopian society to form the Legion of Super-Heroes and fight crime, in homage to the heroes of the twentieth century.</p><p>This latest reboot of the Legion of Super-Heroes, by Mark Waid and Barry Kitson, is an interesting and amusing one. It doesn't worry about the many decades of Legion history, freely using characters that were killed off long ago, and while the characters generally have the same powers and names (Princess Projectra is one of the notable exceptions), it offers some intriguing explanations of just how those powers work. The title of the volume refers to the Legion's status as cult heroes to a generation of young people, to the dismay of their parents, including those of the Legionnaires themselves. And it seems that internal strife is as much of a threat to the organization as are the earth-moving Elysion and Terror Firma. The 2004-2005 run (encompassing <i>Teen Titans/Legion Special</i> 1 and <i>Legion of Super-Heroes</i> 1-6) is funny and sexy, but the art isn't the most attractive that's ever graced the LSH. <i>--David Horiuchi</i>The Legion of Superheroes has been around since the '60s and has been rebooted more times than Windows 98. This version, by Waid and Kitson (<i>Empire</i>), showcases the teenage supergroup of the future as a genuine youth movement, rebelling against their parents' stultifyingly utopian government. In the process, they face off against runaway robots, planetary governments, ruthless mercenaries and, best of all, one another. Superhero guru Waid pulls out all the stops for this revamp. He does have a few moments of being a little too inside-joke cute: the character Colossal Boy, for example, insists on being called Micro-Lad because he's a giant who can shrink to six feet tall. But for the most part Waid strikes a nice balance between social-minded science fiction, manga-fied teenage soap opera and all-out action. Most of the story is character-driven, focusing on internal conflicts among team members rather than just the supervillain of the month. Kitson's art is top-notch: realistic enough to ground the more fantastic elements without ever losing sight of the fact that comic-book futures work best when they're sleek and colorful. This is a Legion that could attract that ever-elusive mainstream audience. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Sadly, he might have added this novel to the list. Resurrecting Scylla, the agent from Marathon Man who is the brother of Babe Levy, hero of that earlier book, Goldman offers an unbelievable story that lacks the plot cohesion and tenacious suspense of its predecessor. Believed dead, Scylla has in fact been hidden away, his face altered, his voice changed, making him the perfect killing machine. His assassin's skills honed to perfection, he is brought back into action by "Division," the mysterious agency for which he works, as part of a plan to permanently alter the balance of world nuclear power. The author spices the plot by introducing a host of super-secret weapons, among them a drug that forces compliance, a liquid that induces suicide, and an almost superhuman killer simply known as The Blonde. Goldman (Magic, Heat, Boys and Girls Together, etc.) is best at depicting nonstop action, and there is plenty to spare here, much of it wildly imaginative. But it is all window dressing, as the book's basic premise fails to hold together. 50,000 first printing; $50,000 ad/promo; Literary Guild dual main selection. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.In this belated sequel to Marathon Man Goldman jumps several years into the future of the Levy brothers. Thomas is now a history professor at Columbia, and Scylla, the lethal secret agent left for dead in New York's Lincoln Center, has been restored and reactivated as a top-level killer by his shadowy masters in the U.S. government. In the nether world of Washington policymaking science has become a major weapon in a bizarre struggle between hawks and doves, and Scylla's assigned role is to eliminate two scientists whose invention of new creative killing methods may be more dangerous than the problem they set out to solve. The imaginative, if sometimes bizarre, plot winds its way through seemingly unconnected episodes of considerable violence before reaching an ironic conclusion which pulls all the threads together.

Davenport&#39;s meditations on the still life dip into the full history of this art form, touching on neolithic cave paintings, the Dutch masters, Cezanne, Van Gogh, even photography and the collage.</p><p>Guy Davenport is a translator, poet, critic, essayist, and writer of short fiction. He has won translation awards from both PEN and the Academy of American Poets. Davenport has been a Rhodes Scholar and a MacArthur Fellow, and received the Morton Dauwen Zabel Award from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. He lives in Lexington, Kentucky.Urbane meditations on the history and meaning of the still life in art and literature. Essayist, poet, translator, and fiction writer Davenport (The Cardiff Team, 1996, etc.) takes as his subject the idea of the still life in art. However, he doesnt offer any sort of academically systematic treatise of the topic. Instead, its more accurate to say that he takes the idea of harmonious disarray in art as a way of focusing and stimulating his own wide-ranging and historically literate imagination. Here is a conservative sample of the Davenport mode of verbal meditation: ``The pipe begins to appear in Renaissance still lifes as a memento mori: life passes away like smoke. An extinguished candle usually accompanied a pipe, and books and food and musical instruments added up to the vanity of our brief life. The nineteenth century would transmute these symbols into ones of peace, cosiness, and domesticity, until in Picasso and Braque they are emblems of shrinking privacy, the precious vestiges of harmony in a distracting and insane world.'' Sometimes his leaps of imagination and lists of connections strain credulity. This kind of thing can be dazzling or irritating, depending on how you feel about argument and documentation. Davenport knows this, of course, and aims by virtue of his book's ``disarray of perceptions and conjunctions'' to charm his consenting partner into a like state of meditation on van Gogh, on Nietzsche, on Edgar Allen Poe, on the persistence of apples and pears in the Western imagination, on the assemblage of objects on Sherlock Holmes's desk at 221B Baker Street. Davenport has the wonderful ability to ``read'' inanimate objects in their historical setting, and he seems to remember everything he ever read. The range of allusion is immense and challenging and rewarding. Davenport is a virtuoso of the literary essay, and here the magic mostly works.

I&#x2019;m sitting here among the shards of my life as I know it, and you&nbsp;...if I know you, you just woke up. You&#x2019;re probably eating oatmeal and watching Sally Jessy Raphael. E-mail me when you get in, before you do anything else. Don&#x2019;t even read the comics.</p><p>&lt;&gt; Okay, I&#x2019;m putting you before the comics, but make it quick. I&#x2019;ve got an ongoing argument with Derek about whether For Better or For Worse is set in Canada, and today might be the day they prove me right.</p><p>&lt;&gt; I think I&#x2019;m pregnant.</p><p>&lt;&gt; What? Why do you think you&#x2019;re pregnant?</p><p>&lt;&gt; I had three drinks last Saturday.</p><p>&lt;&gt; I think we need to have a little talk about the birds and the bees. That&#x2019;s not exactly how it happens.</p><p>&lt;&gt; Whenever I have too much to drink, I start to feel pregnant. I think it&#x2019;s because I never drink, and it would just figure that the one time I decide to loosen up, I get pregnant. Three hours of weakness, and now I&#x2019;m going to spend the rest of my life wrestling with the special needs of a fetal alcoholic.</p><p>&lt;&gt; I don&#x2019;t think they call them that.</p><p>&lt;&gt; Its little eyes will be too far apart, and everyone will look at me in the grocery store and whisper, &#x201c;Look at that horrible lush. She couldn&#x2019;t part with her Zima for nine months. It&#x2019;s tragic.&#x201d;</p><p>&lt;&gt; You drink Zima?</p><p>&lt;&gt; It&#x2019;s really quite refreshing.</p><p>&lt;&gt; You&#x2019;re not pregnant.</p><p>&lt;&gt; I am.</p><p>Normally, two days before my period, my face is broken out, and I get pre-cramps cramping. But my skin is as clear as a baby&#x2019;s bottom. And instead of cramps, I feel this strangeness in my womb region. Almost a presence.</p><p>&lt;&gt; I dare you to call Ask-A-Nurse and tell them that you&#x2019;ve got a presence in your womb region.</p><p>&lt;&gt; Given: This is not my first pregnancy scare. I will acknowledge that thinking I&#x2019;m pregnant is practically a part of my monthly premenstrual regimen. But I&#x2019;m telling you, this is different. I feel different. It&#x2019;s like my body is telling me, &#x201c;It has Begun.&#x201d;</p><p>I can&#x2019;t stop worrying about what happens next. First I get sick. And then I get fat. And then I die of an aneurysm in the delivery room.</p><p>&lt;&gt; OR&nbsp;...and then you give birth to a beautiful child. (See how you&#x2019;ve tricked me into playing along with your pregnancy fiction?)</p><p>&lt;&gt; OR&nbsp;...and then I give birth to a beautiful child, whom I never see because he spends all his waking hours at the day-care center with some minimum-wage slave he thinks is his mother. Mitch and I try to eat dinner together after the baby&#x2019;s in bed, but we&#x2019;re both so tired all the time. I start to doze off while he tells me about his day; he&#x2019;s relieved because he wasn&#x2019;t up to talking anyway. He eats his sloppy joe in silence and thinks about the shapely new consumer-science teacher at the high school. She wears black pumps and nude panty hose and rayon skirts that shimmy up her thighs whenever she sits down.</p><p>&lt;&gt; What does Mitch think? (About the Presence in your womb. Not the new consumer-science teacher.)</p><p>&lt;&gt; He thinks I should take a pregnancy test.</p><p>&lt;&gt; Good man. Perhaps a common-sensical kind of guy like Mitch would have been better off with that home ec teacher. (She&#x2019;d never make sloppy joes for dinner.) But I guess he&#x2019;s stuck with you, especially now that there&#x2019;s a special-needs child on the way.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p></p><p></p><p>&#x201c;LINCOLN, YOU LOOK terrible.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks, Mom.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d have to take her word for it. He hadn&#x2019;t looked in a mirror today. Or yesterday. Lincoln rubbed his eyes and ran his fingers through his hair, trying to smooth it down&nbsp;...or maybe just over. Maybe he should have combed it when he got out of the shower last night.</p><p>&#x201c;Seriously, look at you. And look at the clock. It&#x2019;s noon. Did you just wake up?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mom, I don&#x2019;t get off work until one a.m.&#x201d;</p><p>She frowned, then handed him a spoon. &#x201c;Here,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;stir these beans.&#x201d; She turned on the mixer and half shouted over it. &#x201c;I still don&#x2019;t understand what you do in that place that can&#x2019;t be done in daylight.... No, honey, not like that, you&#x2019;re just petting them. Really stir.&#x201d;</p><p>Lincoln stirred harder. The whole kitchen smelled like ham and onions and something else, something sweet. His stomach was growling. &#x201c;I told you,&#x201d; he said, trying to be heard, &#x201c;somebody has to be there. In case there&#x2019;s a computer problem, and&nbsp;...I don&#x2019;t know&nbsp;...&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What don&#x2019;t you know?&#x201d; She turned off the mixer and looked at&nbsp;him.</p><p>&#x201c;I think maybe they want me to work at night so that I don&#x2019;t get close to anyone else.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, if I got to know people,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I might&nbsp;...&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stir. Talk and stir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If I got to know people&#x201d;&#x2014;he stirred&#x2014;&#x201c;I might not feel so impartial when I&#x2019;m enforcing the rules.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I still don&#x2019;t like that you read other people&#x2019;s mail. Especially at night, in an empty building. That shouldn&#x2019;t be someone&#x2019;s job.&#x201d; She tasted whatever she was mixing with her finger, then held the bowl out to him. &#x201c;Here, taste this&nbsp;...What kind of world do we live in, where that&#x2019;s a career?&#x201d;</p><p>He ran his finger around the edge of the bowl and tasted it. Icing.</p><p>&#x201c;Can you taste the maple syrup?&#x201d;</p><p>He nodded. &#x201c;The building isn&#x2019;t really empty,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;There are people working up in the newsroom.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you talk to them?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. But I read their e-mail.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not right. How can people express themselves in a place like that? Knowing someone&#x2019;s lurking in their thoughts.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not in their thoughts. I&#x2019;m in their computers, in the company&#x2019;s computers. Everyone knows it&#x2019;s happening&nbsp;...&#x201d; It was hopeless trying to explain it to her. She&#x2019;d never even seen e-mail.</p><p>&#x201c;Give me that spoon,&#x201d; she sighed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll ruin the whole batch.&#x201d; He gave her the spoon and sat down at the kitchen table, next to a plate of steaming corn bread. &#x201c;We had a mailman once,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Remember? He&#x2019;d read our postcards? And he&#x2019;d always make these knowing comments. &#x2018;Your friend is having a good time in South Carolina, I see.&#x2019; Or, &#x2018;I&#x2019;ve never been to Mount Rushmore myself.&#x2019; They must all read postcards, all those mailmen. Mail people. It&#x2019;s a repetitive job. But this one was almost proud of it&#x2014;gloaty. I think he told the neighbors that I subscribed to Ms.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not like that,&#x201d; Lincoln said, rubbing his eyes again. &#x201c;I only read enough to see if they&#x2019;re breaking a rule. It&#x2019;s not like I&#x2019;m reading their diaries or something.&#x201d;</p><p>His mother wasn&#x2019;t listening.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you hungry? You look hungry. You look deficient, if you want&nbsp;to know the truth. Here, honey, hand me that plate.&#x201d; He got up and handed her a plate, and she caught him by the wrist. &#x201c;Lincoln&nbsp;...What&#x2019;s wrong with your hands?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing&#x2019;s wrong.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Look at your fingers&#x2014;they&#x2019;re gray.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s ink.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ink.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>WHEN LINCOLN WORKED at McDonald&#x2019;s in high school, the cooking oil got into everything. When he came home at night, he felt all over the way your hands feel when you get done eating French fries. The oil would get into his skin and his hair. The next day, he would sweat it out into his school clothes.</p><p>At The Courier, it was ink. A gray film over everything, no matter how much anyone cleaned. A gray stain on the textured walls and the acoustic ceiling tiles.</p><p>The night copy editors actually handled the papers, every edition, hot off the presses. They left gray fingerprints on their keyboards and desks. They reminded Lincoln of moles. Serious people with thick glasses and gray skin. That might just be the lighting, he thought. Maybe he wouldn&#x2019;t recognize them in the sunshine. In full color.</p><p>They surely wouldn&#x2019;t recognize him. Lincoln spent most of his time at work in the information technology office downstairs. It had been a&nbsp;darkroom about five years and two dozen fluorescent lights ago, and with all of the lights and the computer servers, it was like sitting inside a headache.</p><p>Lincoln liked getting called up to the newsroom, to reboot a machine or sort out a printer. The newsroom was wide and open, with a long wall of windows, and it was never completely empty. The nightside editors worked as late as he did. They sat in a clump at one end of the room, under a bank of televisions. There were two, who sat together, right next to the printer, who were young and pretty. (Yes, Lincoln had decided, you could be both pretty and molelike.) He wondered if people who worked nights went on dates during the day.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p></p><p></p><p>From: Beth Fremont<br> To: Jennifer Scribner-Snyder<br> Sent: Fri, 08/20/1999 10:38 AM<br> Subject: I sort of hate to ask, but&nbsp;...</p><p>Are we done pretending that you&#x2019;re pregnant?</p><p>&lt;&gt; Not for 40 weeks. Maybe 38 by now&nbsp;...</p><p>&lt;&gt; Does that mean we can&#x2019;t talk about other things?</p><p>&lt;&gt; No, it means we should talk about other things. I&#x2019;m trying not to dwell on it.</p><p>&lt;&gt; Good plan.</p><p>Okay. So. Last night, I got a call from my little sister. She&#x2019;s getting married.</p><p>&lt;&gt; Doesn&#x2019;t her husband mind?</p><p>&lt;&gt; My other little sister. Kiley. You met her boyfriend&nbsp;...fianc�, Brian, at my parents&#x2019; house on Memorial Day. Remember? We were making fun of the Sigma Chi tattoo on his ankle&nbsp;...</p><p>&lt;&gt; Right, Brian. I remember. We like him, right?</p><p>&lt;&gt; We love him. He&#x2019;s great. He&#x2019;s just the kind of guy you hope your daughter will meet someday at an upside-down-margarita party.</p><p>&lt;&gt; Is that a fetal-alcoholic joke?</p><p>This wedding is your parents&#x2019; fault. They named her Kiley. She was doomed from birth to marry a hunky, fratty premed major.</p><p>&lt;&gt; Pre-law. But Kiley thinks he&#x2019;ll end up running his dad&#x2019;s plumbing supply company.</p><p>&lt;&gt; Could be worse.</p><p>&lt;&gt; It could hardly be better.</p><p>&lt;&gt; Oh. I&#x2019;m sorry. I just now got that this wasn&#x2019;t good news. What did Chris say?</p><p>&lt;&gt; The usual. That Brian&#x2019;s a tool. That Kiley listens to too much Dave Matthews. Also, he said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got practice tonight, so don&#x2019;t wait up, hey, hand me those Zig-Zags, would you, are you in the wedding? Cool, at least I&#x2019;ll get to see you in another one of those Scarlett O&#x2019;Hara dresses. You&#x2019;re a hot bridesmaid, come here. Did you listen to that tape I left for you? Danny says I&#x2019;m playing all over his bass line, but Jesus, I&#x2019;m doing him a favor.&#x201d;</p><p>And then he proposed. In Bizarro World.</p><p>In the real world, Chris is never going to propose. And I can&#x2019;t decide if that makes him a jerk&#x2014;or if maybe I&#x2019;m the jerk for wanting it so bad. And I can&#x2019;t even talk to him about it, about marriage, because he would say that he does want it. Soon. When he&#x2019;s got some momentum going. When the band is back on track. That he doesn&#x2019;t want to be a drag on me, he doesn&#x2019;t want me to have to support him&nbsp;...</p><p>Please don&#x2019;t point out that I already support him&#x2014;because that&#x2019;s only mostly true.</p><p>&lt;&gt; Mostly? You pay his rent.</p><p>&lt;&gt; I pay the rent. I would have to pay rent anyway&nbsp;...I would have to pay the gas bill and the cable bill and everything else if I lived alone. I wouldn&#x2019;t save a nickel if he moved out.</p><p>Besides, I don&#x2019;t mind paying most of the bills now, and I won&#x2019;t mind doing it after we&#x2019;re married. (My dad has always paid my mom&#x2019;s bills, and no one calls her a parasite.)</p><p>It isn&#x2019;t the who-pays-the-bills issue that&#x2019;s a problem. It&#x2019;s the acting-like-an-adult issue. It&#x2019;s acceptable in Chris&#x2019;s world for a guy to live with his girlfriend while he works on a demo. It&#x2019;s not as cool&nbsp;to chase your guitar fantasy while your wife&#x2019;s at work.</p><p>If you have a wife, you&#x2019;re an adult. That&#x2019;s not who Chris wants to be.

Nafziger, author of <i>Napoleon's Invasion of Russia</i></b><br><br>On June 23, 1812, Napoleon's Grande Arm�e, over 500,000 men strong, poured over the Russian border. An equally massive Russian army faced them. The ensuing campaign was a catastrophe for Napoleon. Although the battle of Borodino, which resulted in heavy losses on both sides, allowed Napoleon to enter Moscow, his stay in that empty and decimated city was disastrous. By the time Napoleon had retreated to the Berezina river in late November, his Grande Arm�e was only a fifth of its original strength. His retreat had become a rout, and his allies began to desert him. <br><br>In this book, Clausewitz analyzes all the significant players with sharp and enlightening characterizations, and provides perhaps the best eyewitness accounts of the battle of Borodino and the Convention of Tauroggen. <i>The Campaign of 1812 in Russia </i>is a brilliantly observed study of one of the major turning points of history.<i><br></i><i>New foreword by Sir Michael Howard</i><br></p><p>In this book, Clausewitz analyzes all the significant players with sharp and enlightening characterizations, and provides perhaps the best eyewitness accounts of the battle of Borodino and the Convention of Tauroggen.

Fixico, author of <i>The Daily Life of American Indians in the Twentieth Century</i>&nbsp;&#x201c;This easily accessible book lifts the veil on that part of Seminole history, following the Seminole Wars, which is cloaked in darkness, as the Seminoles sought to rebuild their culture with little contact with outsiders.&#x201d;&#x2014;Annette L. Snapp, Florida Gulf Coast University&nbsp;In April 1905, A. W. Dimock, a New York financier, and his thirty-one-year-old son Julian, motored their boat across Chokoloskee Bay. They docked at George Storter&#x2019;s store in the small outpost of Everglade on the southwest coast of Florida, at the very edge of Anglo civilization.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> At Storter&#x2019;s, the Dimocks saw several Seminole Indians who came from their homes in the interior of south Florida to shop and trade for household goods. Survivors of three wars, these proud people kept to themselves. Julian, an accomplished photographer, set up his camera and expressed an interest in learning more about their lives. Over the next five years he would amass an unprecedented photographic record of the Seminole people and their surroundings.

Tanning.</p><p>Robert Anson Heinlein was born in Missouri in 1907, and was raised there. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1929, but was forced by illness to retire from the Navy in 1934. He settled in California and over the next five years held a variety of jobs while doing post-graduate work in mathematics and physics at the University of California. In 1939 he sold his first science fiction story to <b>Astounding</b> magazine and soon devoted himself to the genre. <p> He was a four-time winner of the Hugo Award for his novels <b>Stranger in a Strange Land</b> (1961), <b>Starship Troopers</b> (1959), <b>Double Star</b> (1956), and <b>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</b> (1966). His <b>Future History</b> series, incorporating both short stories and novels, was first mapped out in 1941. The series charts the social, political, and technological changes shaping human society from the present through several centuries into the future. </p><p> Robert A. Heinlein's books were among the first works of science fiction to reach bestseller status in both hardcover and paperback. he continued to work into his eighties, and his work never ceased to amaze, to entertain, and to generate controversy. By the time hed died, in 1988, it was evident that he was one of the formative talents of science fiction: a writer whose unique vision, unflagging energy, and persistence, over the course of five decades, made a great impact on the American mind.</p></p><h2>Homestead and Warm Springs Valley, Virginia: A Pictorial Heritage</h2><p>The Homestead, in the high mountains of Virginia, has been a world class resort since the 1890&#x2019;s. 100 pages, with color and black and white photos throughout.

Set on the post-colonial West Indian island of Bimshire in 1952, <em>The Polished Hoe </em>unravels over the course of 24 hours but spans the lifetime of one woman and the collective experience of a society informed by slavery. <br><br> As the novel opens, Mary Mathilda is giving confession to Sargeant, a police officer she has known all her life. The man she claims to have murdered is Mr. Belfeels, the village plantation owner for whom she has worked for more than thirty years. Mary has also been Mr. Belfeels' mistress for most of that time and is the mother of his only son, Wilbeforce, a successful doctor. <br><br> What transpires through Mary's words and recollections is a deep meditation about the power of memory and the indomitable strength of the human spirit. Infused with Joycean overtones, this is a literary masterpiece that evokes the sensuality of the tropics and the tragic richness of Island culture.</p></p><p><p>Culminating with the international success of <em>The Polished Hoe</em> in 2002, Austin Clarke&#x2019;s work since 1964 includes ten novels, six short-story collections, and three memoirs published in the United States, England, Canada, Australia and Holland. In 1998, Clarke was invested with the Order of Canada, and has received four honorary doctorates. In 1999 he won the W.O. Mitchell Prize and the Martin Luther King Junior Award for Excellence in Writing. He lives in Toronto.</p>Clarke, considered one of Canada's finest political novelists, but less well known in the U.S. (a memoir, Pig Tails 'n Breadfruit, was published by the New Press in 2000), gets a new launching in this country with this eloquent, richly detailed novel, awarded Canada's Giller Prize. A murder takes place in the 1950s on the fictional Caribbean island of Bimshire (a stand-in for Clarke's native Barbados), where the culture of English gardens and cricket contrasts sharply with the legacy of slavery. The murderer is Mary Gertrude Mathilda, a respected elderly black matriarch. But the identity of the victim is less clear. In the 24 hours covered by Austin's tale, Mary is determined to tell the police about the lifetime of degradations that led up to her homicidal rage, and Sgt. Percy Stuart, a black member of the police force, is determined to stop her. Percy is in love with Mary, but his life has been a continual compromise with the still-lingering plantation system. Nobody represents the system better than Mr. Bellfeels, the white manager of the sugar plantation at the center of the villagers' lives. When she was 13, Mary was, in essence, bartered to Bellfeels by her mother, who was his previous mistress. For 38 years, she bore his groping and his children. Though he has helped their son, Wilberforce, become a doctor, Bellfeels has never shown Mary herself any kindness. At times, Clarke loses confidence in his characters and has them deliver forced sociological truths-for instance, when Mary gives a lecture about Christopher Columbus. Most of the story, however, unfolds through brilliantly written dialogue, a rich, dancing patois that fills out the dimensions of the island's painful history and its complex caste system. Like Texaco, by Martinique writer Patrick Chamoiseau, Clarke's novel, by harnessing the genius of Creole, shows how art can don a liberating face.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Knowledge of the Holy: The Attributes of God : Their Meaning in the Christian Life</h2><p><p>An Inspiring Classic on the Nature of God </p><p>What is the nature of God?

W. Tozer asserts that the cause of many of our modern spiritual woes is the loss in today's church of a lofty concept of God. He argues persuasively that the cure lies in our rediscovery of God's majesty. "What comes into our minds when we think about God is the most important thing about us," he writes. "The history of mankind will probably show that no people has ever risen above its religion, and man's spiritual history will positively demonstrate that no religion has ever been greater than its idea of God." <em>The Knowledge of the Holy</em> bearseloquent witness to the concept of God's majesty, encourages reverent meditation on the being of God, and offers a way to bring back spiritual power to our lives.</p>Although he never received any formal theological training, A.W.

The brilliance of the Spanish originals is matched with luminous English versions rendered by a remarkable cast of translators, among them W.S. Merwin, John Updike, Robert Fitzgerald, Mark Strand and Alastair Reid.</p><p>During his life, Jorge Luis Borges wore many hats. He was, variously, a poet, an essayist, a short-story writer, a librarian, and, for a short time, a poultry inspector. Born in Argentina in 1899, he lived for several years in Europe before eventually returning home to Buenos Aires in the early 1920s. It was here that Borges started his career as a writer. At the age of 24, he published his first volume of poetry, and though he would go on to garner considerable acclaim as an essayist and crafter of fiction, he always considered himself first and foremost a poet. This bilingual edition of <i>Selected Poems</i>, edited by Alexander Coleman, gathers together 200 poems from different periods of Borges's life, including some that will be appearing in English for the first time. <p> Whether he was writing fiction, essays, or poetry, there were certain themes and subjects that Borges returned to time and again. His home town became a favorite topic--in his first collection, <i>Fervor de Buenos Aires</i>, he wrote: "My soul is in the streets / of Buenos Aires," a sentiment that remained constant throughout his life. This collection reveals other preoccupations as well--with history in all its permutations, Borges's own ancestry, and his fascination with metaphysics, mazes, mirror images, and the blurry line between parallel realities: </p><blockquote> The celibate white cat surveys himself <br> in the mirror's clear-eyed glass, <br> not suspecting that the whiteness facing him <br> and those gold eyes that he's not seen before <br> in ramblings through the house are his own likeness. <br> Who is to tell him the cat observing him <br> is only the mirror's way of dreaming? <br> </blockquote> This companion volume to Andrew Hurley's new translation of <i>Collected Fictions</i> boasts a stellar cast of translators, including W.S. Merwin, Mark Strand, and John Updike among others. Admirers of Borges will find <i>Selected Poems</i> a fitting memorial to the great man; and for those have never had the pleasure of reading him before, this book is a wonderful introduction. <i>--Alix Wilber</i>Though universally acclaimed for his dazzling fictions, Jorge Luis Borges always considered himself first and foremost a poet. A decade before writing his earliest stories, Borges published his first book of poems. And even in that precocious debut, the twenty-four-year-old poet claimed for himself the principal themes that would preoccupy him for the next half century: the cult of his ancestors and his "mysterious habit called Buenos Aires"; the enigma of time and the many yesterdays of history; the metaphysics of Schopenhauer and Berkeley; the now-familiar mirrors, mazes, and swords.<p>This new bilingual selection brings together some two hundred poems -- the largest collection of Borges' poetry ever assembled in English, including scores of poems never previously translated. Edited by Alexander Coleman, the selection draws from a lifetime's work -- from Borges's first published volume of verse, Fervor de Buenos Aires (1923), to his final work, Los conjurados, published just a year before his death in 1986. Throughout this unique collection the brilliance of the Spanish originals is matched by luminous English versions rendered by a remarkable cast of translators: Willis Barnstone, Alexander Coleman, Robert Fitzgerald, Stephen Kessler, Kenneth Krabbenhoft, Eric McHenry, W. S. Merwin, Alastair Reid, Hoyt Rogers, Mark Strand, Charles Tomlinson, Alan S. Trueblood, and John Updike.</p><p>When Penguin published Andrew Hurley's new translation of Borges' Collected Fictions last year, the book was hailed in The New York Times as "an event, a cause for celebration". Now, the celebration continues with Selected Poems, the second installment in Penguin's three-volume edition of Borges' collectedworks in English.</p></p><h2>Mortality</h2><p>On June 8, 2010, while on a book tour for his bestselling memoir, <i>Hitch-22</i>, Christopher Hitchens was stricken in his New York hotel room with excruciating pain in his chest and thorax. As he would later write in the first of a series of award-winning columns for Vanity Fair, he suddenly found himself being deported "from the country of the well across the stark frontier that marks off the land of malady." Over the next eighteen months, until his death in Houston on December 15, 2011, he wrote constantly and brilliantly on politics and culture, astonishing readers with his capacity for superior work even in extremis.<br>Throughout the course of his ordeal battling esophageal cancer, Hitchens adamantly and bravely refused the solace of religion, preferring to confront death with both eyes open. In this riveting account of his affliction, Hitchens poignantly describes the torments of illness, discusses its taboos, and explores how disease transforms experience and changes our relationship to the world around us. By turns personal and philosophical, Hitchens embraces the full panoply of human emotions as cancer invades his body and compels him to grapple with the enigma of death.<b><br></b><b>MORTALITY</b> is the exemplary story of one man's refusal to cower in the face of the unknown, as well as a searching look at the human predicament. Crisp and vivid, veined throughout with penetrating intelligence, Hitchens's testament is a courageous and lucid work of literature, an affirmation of the dignity and worth of man.<br></p><p><b>Amazon Best Books of the Month, September 2012:</b> Curious and prolific to the end, combative writer Christopher Hitchens leaves us with a posthumously published analysis of his dying days. <i>Mortality</i> is the anti&#x2013;<i>Last Lecture</i>: Stripping away semantics and sentimentality, Hitchens treats his cancer as he would any other topic--with dogged inquisitiveness and brutal honesty. Which makes it all the more poignant when he begins losing his voice, his "freedom of speech," and sinks deeper into his "year of living dyingly." Funny, smart, irreverent, and surprisingly moving, this lucid, unflinching end-of-life journey through "Tumorville" is brave and powerful stuff. The unfinished jottings that comprise the final pages are a heartbreaking display of a mind that never stopped till the very end. --<i>Neal Thompson</i>Christopher Hitchens was a contributing editor to <i>Vanity Fair</i>, <i>Slate</i>, and <i>The Atlantic</i>, and the author of numerous books, including works on Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, and George Orwell. He also wrote the international bestsellers <i>god Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything</i>, <i>Hitch-22: A Memoir</i>, and <i>Arguably</i>. He died in 2011.</p><h2>A Birthday for Cow!

It features a wide variety of figures and motifs&#x2015;including hex signs, stylized birds and animals; fruit, floral, and leaf patterns; depictions of angels, mermaids, and other human and semi-human figures; scrolls, tendrils, and simple geometric ornament&#x2015;that were used to decorate everything from the smallest household utensil to the sides of barns and carriages. The possibilities of their modern application are limited only by the imagination of the individual decorator.<br>Detailed practical instructions are provided for each type of decoration. The author carefully explains techniques for both free-hand work and stenciling, covering every aspect of the subject: preparation of surfaces; choice of materials and paint and where they can best be obtained; application of leaf; methods of enlarging designs; and finishing. She has included a large number of specific projects with patterns that are easy to follow. For the collector there are recommendations about restoration and preservation. In addition, to give the reader an idea of the great variety of uses for these designs, there are over 180 photographs of floor coverings and fireboards; decorations on doors and windows; tin trays, pitchers and boxes; picture frames, clocks, chests, chairs, and practically every other item of household use, chosen from museums and private collections.<br>In chapters that deal individually with tinware, furniture, accessories, fabrics, architectural decoration, coach and sign painting, and fracture, Jean Lipman, the noted authority on early American art, provides extensive discussion of the history of the craft. She emphasizes the development of a native style through modifications brought over from England and the addition of a specifically American iconography. This aspect of the book will be found useful by anyone who is interested in the history of art in America.</p></p><p></p><h2>Dictations: On Haunted Writing</h2><p>Avital Ronell, author of <i>Crack Wars</i> and <i>The Telephone Book</i>, defies the undefiable. In <i>Dictations</i> she looks at Goethe, the dictator. A figure whose every word is treated with reverence by Germanists, Goethe is exemplary. But of what? As if teetering between life and death, Goethe was born in a legendary way: thought to be stillborn, he was brought to life by extraordinary efforts. Eighty-three years later he died, or seemed to, and was praised as an immortal spirit. His spirit immediately began to haunt.&nbsp;Four years later Johann Peter Eckermann published two volumes recounting his conversations with Goethe. Goethe quickly got the best of him. He spoke eerily through Eckermann to a world eager to hear his latest words. Eckermann's books are usually considered to be by Goethe, and Eckermann himself has become another of Goethe's creations.&nbsp;The master of <i>Faust and Wilhelm Meister</i> keeps coming back. He visited the dreams and anxieties of persons as sensitive as Kafka, Nietzsche, and Freud, speaking up in quotations or casting his shadow over poems, stories, and the birth pangs of psychoanalysis. He is a difficult case.&nbsp;Avita Ronell has never shied from the difficult. In <i>Dictations</i>, her first book, originally published in 1986, she starts at the edge of an abyss&#x2014;the question of spirit, as exemplified by an author whose writings transcended even himself. Often invoked but never seen, spirit has been a matter literary scholars have declined to look at or look for. Here, though restless, it comes into view. In a new preface, Ronell describes the circumstances surrounding the writing and reception of the book.</p><p><p>Channeling Goethe with one of literary criticism&#x2019;s most imaginative and inimitable mediums</p><p></p><p></p><p>One of the most influential of Goethe's works is one he didn't write but dictated to a young companion. Four years after his death at the age of eighty-three, the great poet spoke again from beyond the grave in Conversations with Eckermann, Johann Peter Eckermann's account of his time with Goethe in the last years of his life. Proclaimed by Nietzsche to be &#x201c;the best German book,&#x201d; Conversations with Eckermann contains Goethe's last thoughts about art, poetry, politics, religion, and a host of other highly invested areas of concern for the fate of German letters and philosophy.</p><p>In Dictations, Goethe is seen as the undead core of German literary and theoretical production, the basis of a poignant code of symptoms that Avital Ronell tracks and traces. Eckermann, for Ronell, emerges as the hero of haunted writing, the toxically depleted head of the class of Goethe scholars.</p><p></p><p>Avital Ronell is a professor of German, comparative literature, and English at New York University, where she directs the Research in Trauma &amp; Violence project. She is author of The Test Drive and many other books.</p></p><h2>Ralph Compton The Palo Duro Trail (Trail Drive)</h2><p>When Dagstaff signs on to drive four thousand head of cattle up the dangerous Palo Duro trail, he finds himself caught in furious storms, facing Comanche raiders, and with a hired killer among his hands.

He begins each chapter with a discussion of how that particular food fits into the fabric of the meal. The more than 250 recipes include ceviches, escabeches, empanadas, tamales, soups, seafood, poultry, meat, vegetables and grains, and desserts; and finally there is a chapter on such basics as how to prepare eggless mayonnaise and corn beer, and how to clean squid. An enormously talented cook and teacher, Felipe brings North Americans the culinary diversity and great food of the continent to our south.</p></p><p><p>Felipe Rojas-Lombardi, a native of a Peru, is the owner and chef of The Ballroom restaurant in New York City. He is the author of <em>Soup, Beautiful Soup.</em></p>Squid ceviche, wild-turkey escab&#x160;che with figs, seafood tamale, quinoa chowder, tomatillo gazpacho, rabbit in chocolate sauce, a roundly flavored sweet pepper-dried chili-apple-hazelnut sauce to serve on potatoes, and a whole string of wonderful potato dishes: These are a few of the splendid, spicy, South American dishes that Peruvian born-and-raised Rojas-Lombardi, now a prominent New York chef and food authority, makes available in this genuine contribution to our culinary repertoire. True, some of the items used might be unavailable in many North American areas, but many dishes (among them a spicy marinated pork roast) achieve a distinctive effect without exotic ingredients. And Rojas-Lombardi's introduction, ranging from the Incas' ingenious irrigation methods to today's 30-some potato varieties and corn kernels the size of cherry tomatoes, provides an informative overview in a very few lively pages. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

This summer he&#x2019;s hoping for a job where he doesn&#x2019;t have to talk to anyone except his pal Matthew. Then Johanna moves in next door. She&#x2019;s 10 years older, cool, funny, and she treats Finn as an equal. Dylan loves her, too. Johanna&#x2019;s dealing with breast cancer, and Matthew and Finn learn to care for her, emotionally and physically. When she hires Finn to create a garden, his gardening ideas backfire comically. But Johanna and the garden help Finn discover his talents for connecting with people.</p><p>Gary Paulsen is the distinguished author of many critically acclaimed books for young people, His most recent books are Lawn Boy, Molly McGinty Has a Really Good Day, The Time Hackers, The Amazing Life of Birds, and Mudshark.Sometimes having company is not all it's cracked up to be.<br> <br> I was sitting on the front steps of my house with Matthew and Dylan. Matthew was listening to his ear buds, eyes closed, half-humming, half-singing the good parts of the song like he always does, and Dylan was asleep on the ground, snoring and twitching. Matthew's into his music and Dylan's a dog so I didn't pay much attention to either of them. I was trying to read.<br> <br> Matthew's the only true friend I've got.<br> <br> He's not my best friend. That's Carl, because we've always got a lot of the same classes and spend the most time together in school. Matthew's not even my oldest friend. That's Jamie, because I've known her since we went to nursery school together. He's definitely not my most fun friend--that would have to be Christopher, who goes to a school for the gifted and always has some crazy story to tell about the supersmart people he knows.<br> <br> Matthew lives right across the street and is always over at my house. That summer, he was actually living with us, because his parents were in the middle of a divorce. Their house was for sale and they'd each recently moved into nearby apartments. But Matthew had said he wasn't going to learn how to do the shared custody thing on his summer vacation. Then he'd said he'd just stay with us until everything got settled. I was impressed that Matthew called the shots that way, but not surprised that his folks and my dad agreed; Matthew has a way of always making sense so people go along with him.<br> <br> But that's not what makes him my true friend. It's because he's the only person I know who doesn't make me feel like he's drifted off in his head when I'm talking. Anyone who listens to everything you have to say, even the bad stuff and the boring things that don't interest them, is a true friend. Matthew's always been the only person who's easy for me to talk to. He's a lot like Dylan when you think about it.<br> <br> Matthew and I aren't anything alike. I know, for instance, that it's got to be easier to be Matthew than it is to be me. There's something so . . . easy about the way he does everything. He gets better grades than me, even though he hardly ever studies. He's on about a million teams at school, and whatever he does in football, baseball, basketball, tennis or track, he looks confident in a way that I never do.<br> <br> He has friends in every group at school: the brainy people, who, even in middle school, are starting to worry about the "com app" (that's the universal college application form, but I only know that because I Googled the word after I heard them talking about it so much); the jocks, who carpool to their orthopedic doctor appointments together and brag about torn cartilage and bad sprains; the theater and band and orchestra members, who call themselves the arty geeks and then laugh, like it's some big joke on everyone else; and, of course, the losers.<br> Like me.<br> <br> Matthew would never call me a loser, not to my face and not behind my back, either, but we both know that I don't fit in and that I'm just biding my time in middle school, waiting for high school and then college, after which I hope I can get a job where I'll be able to work by myself.<br> <br> It's not that I don't like people, but they make me uncomfortable. I feel like an alien dropped onto a strange planet and that I always have to be on the lookout for clues and cues on how to act and what to say. It's exhausting to always feel like you don't belong anywhere and then worry that you're going to say the wrong thing all the time.<br> <br> Real people seem so . . . mysterious and, I don't know, high-maintenance to me. People in books, though, I like them just fine. I read a lot, partly because when I was little and my dad couldn't afford sitters, he'd drag me to the library for his study groups. He was in night school and he's been there ever since. He'd sit me at a table near him and his classmates and give me a pile of books, a bag of pretzels and some juice boxes.<br> <br> "I wish I had a dollar for every hour I've spent in the library," he always says. I have to agree--we'd probably never have to worry about money again.<br> <br> So now I don't feel normal unless I've got a book in my hands, and I feel the most normal when I'm lost in a story and can ignore the complicated situations around me that never seem to work out as neatly as they do in books.<br> <br> So, on that day, Matthew and Dylan and I were sitting in front of my house. It was a week after school let out for the summer.<br> <br> A completely bald woman drove up, parked in front of the house next door and jumped out of her car.<br> <br> I knew she'd moved in a couple of weeks ago to house-sit for our neighbors, professors on sabbatical. I'd seen her a few times from my kitchen window, but I hadn't spoken to her. I hadn't noticed she was bald, either, and that kind of detail didn't seem like one I'd miss.<br> <br> She was probably in her early twenties. She was wearing faded jeans that looked way too big for her and purple cowboy boots. She carried a leather backpack and had one of those bumpy fisherman sweaters draped over her shoulders even though it was hot.<br> <br> She saw me, waved and headed in our direction.<br> <br> Dylan sat up as she got closer and looked at her with that teeth-baring border collie grin that scares people who don't know that dogs can smile.</p><h2>Magical Girl Apocalypse Vol. 13</h2><p><p><b>A MYSTERIOUS PAST</b></p><p>Time is running out and the apocalypse keeps getting stranger.

Outlawed and exiled from his ancestral home in the north, Ringil has only one place left to turn - Yhelteth, city heart of the southern Empire, where perhaps he can seek asylum with the kiriath half-breed Archeth Indamaninarmal, former war comrade and now high-up advisor to the Emperor Jhiral Khimran II. But Archeth Indamaninarmal has problems of her own to contend with, as does her house guest, bodyguard and one time steppe nomad Egar the Dragonbane. And far from gaining the respite he is seeks, Ringil will instead find himself implicated in fresh schemes and doubtful allegiances no safer than those he has left behind.

But what did Caesar intend to accomplish by writing and publishing his commentaries, how did he go about it, and what potentially unforeseen consequences did his writing have? These are the questions that Andrew Riggsby pursues in this fresh interpretation of one of the masterworks of Latin prose.</p> <p>Riggsby uses contemporary literary methods to examine the historical impact that the commentaries had on the Roman reading public. In the first part of his study, Riggsby considers how Caesar defined Roman identity and its relationship to non-Roman others. He shows how Caesar opens up a possible vision of the political future in which the distinction between Roman and non-Roman becomes less important because of their joint submission to a Caesar-like leader. In the second part, Riggsby analyzes Caesar's political self-fashioning and the potential effects of his writing and publishing the Gallic War. He reveals how Caesar presents himself as a subtly new kind of Roman general who deserves credit not only for his own virtues, but for those of his soldiers as well. Riggsby uses case studies of key topics (spatial representation, ethnography, <em>virtus</em> and technology, genre, and the just war), augmented by more synthetic discussions that bring in evidence from other Roman and Greek texts, to offer a broad picture of the themes of national identity and Caesar's self-presentation.</p></p><p>Andrew M. Riggsby is Associate Professor of Classics at the University of Texas at Austin.</p><h2>Cabal!: The Plot Against General Washington</h2><p>In the spring of 1778, General George Washington wrote to his friend Landon Carter about a rumored &#x201c;disposition in the Northern Officers to see me superceded in my Command.&#x201d; This was as candid a statement as the general ever made about the so-called &#x201c;Conway Cabal&#x201d; of patriot officers and politicians critical of his leadership. Most early historians of the Revolution took the threat to Washington seriously, but by the mid-twentieth century interpretations had reversed, with the plot&#x2014;if one existed&#x2014;posing no real danger to the commander-in-chief. Yet, as historian Mark Edward Lender reveals in his compelling <i>Cabal! The Plot Against General Washington</i>, clues found in original new research provide a more comprehensive understanding of the personalities and political maneuverings of those involved in the Cabal, and the real nature of the challenge to Washington.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rather than the &#x201c;classic Cabal&#x201d; of Generals Horatio Gates, Thomas Mifflin, and Thomas Conway in a plot to remove Washington quickly, the threat to Washington&#x2019;s command was a gradual administrative attempt by the Board of War and political allies to take over the war effort. Reorganized in late 1777 under the leadership of Mifflin, with Gates assuming the board presidency in January 1778, the Board of War sought authority to determine military policy and strategic goals, all training, organizational, personnel, and logistical functions, and even the assignment of theater commanders. Had they succeeded, Washington&#x2019;s title of commander-in-chief would have been utterly hollow. The Cabal tested Washington as few other things did during the war and perhaps tempered him into the man we remember today. Washington adroitly navigated the challenges to his leadership, meeting and defeating every attempt to curtail his authority. His response revealed a leadership style that saw him safely through the war, and gave him overwhelming support from his countrymen to become their first president.</p><p>MARK EDWARD LENDER holds a Ph.D. in American History from Rutgers University. He has written extensively on early American social and military history and is a recognized authority on the War for Independence. Lender&#x2019;s scholarship has won awards from the Society for Military History and the US Army Historical Foundation and a fellowship from the Smith National Library at George Washington&#x2019;s Mount Vernon.

It&#x2019;s almost as though there is a hidden, underground world of power playing females who have all cracked a magical code: they think positively, they support one another, and they truly believe they can have it all &#x2014;and you can, too. There is something dynamic that happens when women genuinely show up for each other. When we lose the facades, when we cut the bullsh*t, and when we truly have each others backs. When we stop pretending everything is perfect, and we show the messy, beautiful parts of ourselves and our work that all look awfully similar. When we talk about our fears, our missteps, and our breakdowns. And most importantly, when we share our celebrations, our breakthroughs, and dish on what works. There is no reason to hoard information, connections, or insight. Wisdom is meant to be shared, so let&#x2019;s start sharing what we&#x2019;ve learned to make each other better. Let&#x2019;s start building each other up. Let's live up to our potential and start ruling the world. GIRL CODE is a roadmap for female entrepreneurs, professional women, &#x201c;side hustlers&#x201d; (those with a day job who are building a business on the side), and anyone in between who wants to become a better woman. This book will not teach you how to build a multimillion dollar business. It won&#x2019;t teach you about systems or operational processes. But it will teach you how to build confidence in yourself, reconnect with your &#x201c;why,&#x201d; eradicate jealousy, and ultimately learn the power of connection. Because at the end of the day, that&#x2019;s what life and business is all about.</p><p>Cara Alwill Leyba is an Author and Master Life Coach from New York City who encourages women to create a "Champagne Life" that entails living effervescently, celebrating themselves every day, and making their happiness a priority.

The book became a runaway success in the UK, hitting number one on the bestseller lists and prompting extraordinary headlines such as Grammar Book Tops Bestseller List (<i>BBC News</i>). With more than 500,000 copies of her book in print in her native England, Lynne Truss is ready to rally the troops on this side of the pond with her rousing cry, Sticklers unite!</p> <p>Through sloppy usage and low standards on the Internet, in e-mail, and now text messages, we have made proper punctuation an endangered species. In <i>Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves</i>, former editor Lynne Truss dares to say, in her delightfully urbane, witty and very English way, that it is time to look at our commas and semicolons and see them as the wonderful and necessary things they are. If there are only pedants left who care, then so be it. This is a book for people who love punctuation and get upset when it is mishandled. From George Orwell shunning the semicolon, to <i>New Yorker</i> editor Harold Ross's epic arguments with James Thurber over commas, this lively history makes a powerful case for the preservation of a system of printing conventions that is much too subtle to be mucked about with.</p></p><p><b>Praise for Lynne Truss and <i>Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves:</i></b> <br><br> <i>Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves</i> "makes correct usage so cool that you have to admire Ms. Truss."<br> &#x2014;JANET MASLIN, <i>THE NEW YORK TIMES</i> <br><br> "Witty, smart, passionate."<br> &#x2014;<i>LOS ANGELES TIMES BOOK REVIEW</i>, BEST BOOKS OF 2004: NONFICTION <br><br> "Who knew grammar could be so much fun?"<br> &#x2014;<i>NEWSWEEK</i> <br><br> "Witty and instructive. . . .

As with other powerful nations throughout history, maritime supremacy has been the key to America&#39;s rise to superpower status and the relative peace of the postwar era. Over the past two decades, however, while Washington has been preoccupied with land wars in the Middle East and targeted drone-centric operations against emerging terrorist threats, the United States Navy&#39;s combat fleet has dwindled to historic lows--the smallest since before World War I. At the same time, rival nations such as China have increased the size of their navies significantly and at an extraordinary rate. Within a matter of years or even months, China will likely have the ability to deny or substantially curtail the U.S. Navy&#39;s ability to operate in the Pacific and to project power in Asia, which could have drastic consequences for the world economy. As Seth Cropsey convincingly argues, the precipitous decline of the U.S. as a great seapower, due in large part to budget cuts, will have profound consequences sooner than we might think. In clear and concise language, Mayday tracks the modern evolution of U.S. maritime strength, where it stands now, and the likely consequences if changes are not made to both the Navy&#39;s size and shape and to the United States&#39; strategic understanding of how to combine maritime and continental force. With the ascent of new powers not likely to slow, the best way to secure both peace and prosperity for the world may be for America to reinvest in the same naval power that made her great.</p><p>Seth Cropsey is the former U.S. Deputy Undersecretary of the Navy, having served under four Secretaries of the Navy in the Reagan and Bush administrations. He also served as an officer in the United States Naval Reserve for nearly two decades. He is now Senior Fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington and a frequent contributor to The Weekly Standard, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post and other publications."From diminished budgets to increased tasks the world over, the rise of potential future naval competitors, and an enfeebled procurement system the United States Navy is in serious trouble. Seth Cropsey's brilliant explanation speaks to a general audience, detailing how the failure to solve these problems will cripple America's position as a global power and risk the United States' future security. Every American should read this extraordinary book." --John Lehman, former United States Secretary of the Navy and member of the 9/11 Commission<br><br> ""Mayday" looks at the past, present, and future of the U.S. Navy and finds a troubling drift toward a smaller fleet and reduced American global influence. Seth Cropsey argues that America's stature as a formidable power has and will parallel her ability to remain the world's great seapower. It is an argument that deserves the widest possible readership." --Jon Kyl, former U.S. Senate Minority Whip<br><br> ""Mayday" is a powerful distress call about the dangerous decline of American seapower. It's also a significant contribution to thinking about American national security policy and to formulating American grand strategy in the 21st century. And it's a good read."--William Kristol, Editor, "The Weekly Standard"<br><br>"In a well-structured narrative, Mr. Cropsey provides a concise and compelling summary of the evolution of American and other great powers' application of and dependence on sea power. He chronicles the waxing and waning of that power and the global order that has come with our nation's ability to command the seas...He wisely advocates that "the most advanced technology should bow to numbers" and argues for pursuing unmanned systems to achieve "decreased cost and increased surveillance and combat power..".."Mayday" is extremely timely, reminding us that security and prosperity are inextricably linked to sea power." --"Wall Street Journal"<br>"Seldom is a book on a military topic so well informed and compelling in regard to the underlying and pertinent historical patterns, strategical necessities, economic truths, and political realities with which Cropsey deals as scholar, academic, high official, analyst, and naval person. His superior intellect, great clarity of vision, long experience, and fundamental courage make this, an enjoyable "tour d'horizon" of naval affairs, truly the book of a soldier/statesman." --Mark Helprin, author of "Winter's Tale"<br><br></p><h2>Stravinsky&#39;s Lunch</h2><p><b>A moving, deeply insightful study of two artists-both twentieth-century Australian women-who lived and worked in divergent realms</b><br><br>Drusilla Modjeska's title derives from an anecdote about the composer who, while creating a piece of music, ordered his family to remain silent while taking a meal with him-so Stravinsky could preserve his concentration on his work. Modjeska's book investigates the life patterns of women artists, most of whom have been unable to manage such a neat compartmentalization of daily life and creativity.<br><br><i>Stravinsky's Lunch</i> tells the stories of two extraordinary women, both born close to the turn of the century in Australia and both destined to make important contributions to Australian painting. Stella Bowen went to London to make her career, then became a bohemian and the longtime mistress of Ford Madox Ford. Grace Cossington Smith, a spinster who never strayed far from her childhood home on the outskirts of Sydney, became one of the first Australian modernists. Their distinctive stories speak volumes about how love, art, and life intersect.<br>Farrar, Straus and Giroux<br></p><p><b>Drusilla Modjeska</b> is an Australian writer whose previous books include <i>Poppy</i> and <i>The Orchard.</i><br>British-born Modjeska is a longtime resident of Australia, where she published Poppy, a fictionalized biography of her mother, and The Orchard, a set of philosophico-feminist fictionalized lives that won a host of prizes down under. This book similarly recounts the separate lives of two lesser-known Australian women painters, Stella Bowen (1893-1947) and Grace Cossington Smith (1894-1984), focusing on their domestic arrangements and compromises. Bowen left Australia in 1914, never to returnDinstead painting, bearing a daughter to the married Ford Maddox Ford in London and unabashedly leading a precarious, bohemian life in Europe. A useful overview of the beginnings of modern Australian painting follow Bowen's often desperate story, before Modjeska picks up Smith in her quiet, Turramurra (Northern Australia) spinsterhood, where she painted what was around her. Modjeska seems much more interested in process than product, though she clearly loves the work of both artists, reproduced here in 85 b&amp;w reproductions and 24 pages of color plates. (Readers may be less convinced.) Unfortunately, the lack of analysis is compounded by a glut of spectacularly banal filler, e.g., when Modjeska states, "The forties are powerful years in a woman's life, but such sweetness as there is, is mixed with the tart taste of time passing." The title refers to an unrelated anecdote in which Stravinsky, while in the throes of composing a piece, asked his family to be silent at lunchtime: the two very different and difficult domestic lives of these two women artists are the intended contrast, but regardless of the worthy intentions, neither the work nor Modjeska's mysticism make it a compelling one.

Catalogue entries for 81 works draw extensively on interviews with the artist. A detailed chronology places Ryman&#39;s work in the context of his major contemporaries.</p><p>Robert Ryman is a nonfigurative artist who makes white paintings. One might think, upon a cursory examination of these works, that Ryman was an academic type, fond of the rhetoric of abstraction. But Ryman is self-taught, self-effacing, and rather romantic. Storr, a curator at the Museum of Modern Art, summarizes Ryman's quiet life and elucidates his passionate but methodical approach to painting with consummate narrative skills, supporting his commentary with excerpts from numerous interviews with the artist and, of course, a superb set of, yes, colorplates. Ryman's first medium was music. A bebop saxophone player, he took a day job as a guard at the Museum of Modern Art and scrutinized the masters for seven years until, suddenly, in 1953, he began to paint. He's been at it ever since. Ryman chose, early on, to work within strict limitations, hence the white paint, and has devoted himself to seeing "what visual riches can be coaxed from such slender means," a mission not unlike the improvisations of jazz. Curiously, like many jazz musicians of his generation, his work has been more highly regarded in Europe than in America, but a major traveling retrospective exhibition, and this fine volume, will increase his visibility and earn him the recognition he deserves. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>1000 Extra/Ordinary Objects</h2><p>TASCHEN&#39;s 25th anniversary - Special edition! &#34;&#34;It&#39;s a visual feast of truly weird and wonderful objects from around the world.&#34;&#34; - Sunday Express, London</p><p>Dirt cupcake mix, as American as apple pie. Nipple lightener from Japan. Tick juice, indispensable in Venezuela for black magic love rituals. Sunglasses from Zimbabwe with shades cut from plastic juice bottles and no lenses. Korean disposable straw sandals made especially for mourners and corpses. Is this stuff cool or what? But wait--there's more. Flip through this book in search of international weirdness, and it's a pretty sure bet you'll wind up absorbing some sobering information about sex, death, destruction, poverty, and the arrogant ways of multinationals. Under the guise of an ultrahip consumer's guide to the world's nifty stuff--divided into sections labeled "Food," "Fashion," "Animals," "Body," "Soul" and "Leisure"-- <i>1000 Extra/Ordinary Objects</i> is a subversive crusader for human rights and ecological awareness. <p> Sure, you can find out how to buy your very own Dom Perignon-flavored sorbet or a CD of "Music for Healthy Pets." But you'll also stumble upon objects like the cute little bright green Russian-made PFM-1 antipersonnel mine, "a favorite toy of generations of Afghan children" punished for their curiosity by a double whammy of liquid explosive and tiny blades. On other pages, seemingly innocuous objects--like the sweetly lumpy doll couples made of tree bark by Elliot Chitungu of Zimbabwe--turn out to have a bitter subtext. (Chitungu, who is gay, makes all his couples heterosexual; in his country, homosexuality is a criminal offense.) Other objects are examples of savvy recycling, like the paper made in Malawi from elephant dung and recycled cardboard.</p> <p> With straightforward descriptions in both English and French, unblinking photographs of young people modeling even the most outr� objects, and a Yellow Pages that includes information about little-known charitable organizations worldwide, this is a fun book with a heart of gold. <i>--Cathy Curtis</i></p></p><h2>Sally and the Some-Thing</h2><p><p>Stuck at home with her mom and her new sibling, Sally heads for the swamp with her fishing pole and bike.

She takes it all in stride, however ('COOOL! said Sally), feeling confident that whatever this thing is, it will not be boring. At first the two have a difficult time finding a game to play together: ...the Some-Thing wasnt very good with crayons. The tea party was a disaster. And the less said about the bicycle, the better. Sally didnt particularly enjoy her new friends favorite things, either. Finally, the two manage to invent a few new activities that they both can enjoy, and they have a terrific afternoon together. Bright, clever cartoon illustrations charged with an amusingly dramatic atmosphere set the stage perfectly for the dry humor of the text. Occasionally the words get lost in the bold illustrations, making reading aloud a little difficult, but the fun story is more than worth the effort. The snappy text and comic pacing make this an ideal read-aloud for generating laughs from the preschool set as well as elementary-aged kids. This friendship story is a treat for any library.<i>&#x2013;Julie Roach, Cambridge Public Library, MA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But beneath the placid veneer, darker truths lie waiting. Her fifteen-year-old, Jessica, is teetering on the cusp of drugs and delinquency. And someone is stalking the troubled teenager. Someone who has already violated their home and stolen their peace of mind.<br><br>A time to love....<br><br>Now the police are involved. Grace is relieved--and worried. Is Jessica in danger from a drug dealer who wants to silence her? Detective Tony Marino is on the case. He's too close for comfort, asking disturbing questions, probing into her long-buried past, igniting feelings Grace has tried to suppress. In Tony's strong arms, Grace finds comfort, protection--passion--as he tries to shield them from the evil lurking just beyond their door....</p><p>Karen Robards is the author of twenty-two historical and contemporary romances, including her most recent national bestsellers <b>The Senator's Wife</b>, <b>Heartbreaker</b>, and <b>Hunter's Moon</b>. She lives in Louisville, Kentucky, with her husband and their three sons.It was just after two A.M., and Jessica's bed was empty.<br><br>Light from the hall spilled over the tumbled bed, leaving the rest of the room deep in shadow. Grace Hart didn't even bother to switch on the overhead light. Her tall, thin figure cast an elongated shadow across the pale rose carpet for no more than an instant. Then she moved. Three quick strides brought her to her daughter's bedside. She yanked the covers clear to the foot of the bed just to make sure, but she already knew what she would find: nothing.<br><br>Jessica was not curled up in a tight little ball beneath the primrose comforter. A hasty glance around confirmed that Jessica was not in the tweedy pink armchair in the corner, or at her white-and-gold desk, or sprawled out with a pillow on the carpet. Grace didn't even have to check to know that Jessica was not in the connecting bathroom, or downstairs in the kitchen. . . . or, in fact, anywhere in the house.<br><br>Her fifteen-year-old daughter had snuck out.<br><br>Again.<br><br><i>Oh, God,</i> Grace thought, staring blindly at the empty bed, <i>what am I going to do?</i><br><br>There was no one but God to ask. She and Jessica lived alone. Grace loved her daughter more than life itself--but lately she had grown terrified that she was losing her. This was the third time in the past two months that she had been awakened--by what? a stealthy sound? a bad dream? she didn't know--and risen from her bed to check on Jessica, only to find her daughter gone.<br><br>It was Monday night--no, Tuesday morning now. A school day. Jessica had to be up at 6:45 a.m. She had a Spanish test first period. Just before bedtime, Grace had spent an hour listening to her daughter conjugate verbs. The test counted double, and a good score could bring her <i>C</i> in that class up to an <i>A,</i> which would be enough to get her on the honor roll. They had both agreed that making the honor roll in high school was important, and Grace, at least, had been psyched about Jessica's chances. But how was she going to do on the test with no sleep?<br><br>Of course, Grace realized even as the question formed in her mind, that was the least of her worries at the moment.<br><br>The overriding one was, <i>where's Jessica</i>?<br><br>She had a pretty good idea who her daughter was with, if not where she was. Now four weeks into her first year of high school, Jessica had fallen in with a new crowd, a "cool" crowd, she said, whose acceptance made her popular. The girls all wore flared jeans, midriff-baring tops, platform shoes, and neon-striped hair. (Talk about d�j� vu all over again: Grace had worn the same kind of thing, minus the Day-Glo hair streaks, when <i>she</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;was in high school. But as Jess pointed out, the seventies were hot again.) Anyway, as far as Grace was concerned, this particular gaggle of girls was bad news rushing headlong toward a bad end. It scared her to realize that Jessica, her own sweet Jessica, was going to find that bad end right along with them if Grace couldn't manage to stop her.<br><br>So far, in the war for Jessica's allegiance, the score was dishearteningly lopsided. Mom had lost every battle.<br><br>A rattle followed by a soft whirring sound made Grace jump. She glanced around.<br><br>"Jessica?"<br><br>There was no answer.<br><br>It took only a moment for Grace to identify the source of the sound: Godzilla in his exercise wheel. The fat golden hamster whose cage sat atop Jessica's bookshelf was running busily, oblivious to the absence of his mistress or her mother's distress.<br><br>"Where is she, buddy?" Grace asked.<br><br>Godzilla ran blithely on. Grace grimaced at herself. Talking to a hamster was sad, she thought, and having nothing but a hamster to talk to at a time of crisis like this was even sadder. At age thirty-six, she had, besides her daughter, a sister, a father, an ex-husband, and a raft of friends and acquaintances, but no one she could pick up the phone and call at two a.m. The pattern had been set for years: she listened to their problems, not vice versa.<br><br><i>She</i> was the strong one in all their lives. The fixer, the problem-solver, the one whose life was always under control.<br><br>Usually she was okay with that. But not tonight.<br><br>Crossing to one of the pair of tall windows that overlooked the front yard, she parted the ruffled pink-plaid curtains, rested her forehead against a cool glass pane, and shut her eyes. Her knee-length blue nylon nightgown had long sleeves, but still she was cold. She folded her arms over her chest, but that didn't help.<br><br><i>What am I doing wrong?</i> The unspoken question repeated itself over and over in time with the pulse throbbing in her head. Trying to ease the pounding, she massaged her temples with her fingertips, then ran her fingers despairingly through her short, blond-streaked brown shag. <i>I love her so. I'm trying my best. What am I doing wrong?</i><br><br>In her position as a Franklin County Juvenile and Domestic Court judge, she dealt with problem children on a daily basis. It was a rare session in court when she was not confronted with teens who were out of control.<br><br>Usually the kid's problem mirrored some kind of breakdown in the family.<br><br>Was that why it was so hard to acknowledge that <i>her</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;daughter was rocketing down the same path as the kids who appeared before her every day? Because she would then have to blame herself?<br><br>Was it not the unpalatable truth that she was as much a failure as a parent as any of those whose children were hauled into her courtroom?<br><br>She loved her daughter so much. She would kill for her. She would die for her. Every success she'd ever had in her life had been achieved for Jessica. How, then, could they have come to this? How was it possible for her to have succeeded in providing Jessica with everything she herself had longed for as a child, yet still have managed to lose Jessica along the way?<br><br>Was Jess out there somewhere drinking? This new reason for fear suddenly popped full-blown into Grace's mind, washing over every other consideration like an ocean swell hitting sand castles on the beach. Jessica had to be so careful--but she wasn't. She refused to be.<br><br>The last time she'd snuck out with the crowd, she'd come home smelling of booze. Although of course she had denied drinking more than a couple of sips from a friend's can of beer; someone had spilled the rest over her clothes, she'd said, to account for the smell.<br><br><i>Yeah, right</i>. As much as Grace longed to believe it, that story didn't ring true. If a kid told her that in her courtroom, she wouldn't have swallowed a word.<br><br>It hurt to acknowledge that Jessica was lying to her. It hurt then, and it hurt now. But then, she'd let her daughter get away with it, on the off chance that she was telling the truth.<br><br>Big mistake, and one that she would not repeat.<br><br>No more Mr. Nice Mommy for Miss Jess. This time, Grace meant to lower the boom.<br><br>But she could do nothing but wait and worry until Jessica came home.<br><br>Grace opened her eyes. From her second-floor vantage point, she could see half a dozen darkened houses stretching to the east and west along their street, Spring Hill Lane. All were two-story, deceptively unpretentious residences built in the '20s and '30s, nestled cozily into tree-dotted grounds of half an acre or more per house. Their own house was of narrow white clapboards, with ten-foot-tall ceilings inside and green-painted shutters outside. It blended with its neighbors harmoniously, though none of them was in precisely the same style. A suburb of Columbus, Ohio, Bexley was an old neighborhood, well established, moneyed, safe. Which was why she had chosen it as the ideal place to bring up her daughter.<br><br>The tall oaks and elms standing sentinel in her own front yard swayed as a gust of wind caught their branches. A flurry of dislodged leaves swirled through the air, then drifted ghostlike toward the ground. Long shadows cast by a high-flying moon shifted and blended into the line of blackness that was the four-foot-tall privet hedge bordering the street. It was September, and the wind would be warm. Moonlight washed the landscape.<br><br>Behind her came the continuous whir of Godzilla on his exercise wheel. The sound was oddly comforting now. At least she was not totally alone in the house.<br><br><i>Jess was okay.</i> She had to keep telling herself that. After all, Jessica was not out in the cold or the rain. She was not lost, and she probably was not alone.<br><br>It was Jessica's mother who was alone. And lost. And scared.<br><br>Out on the lawn, the shadows danced with the wind. One separated itself from the others, moving with seeming purpose toward a far corner of the yard. Grace blinked with surprise, then realized that she was watching someone walk away from her house toward the small, wrought-iron gate in the hedge.<br><br>Jess, or one of her friends. It had to be. This time she had caught her daughter in the act of coming in--or going out.<br><br>Before the thought was finished, Grace whirled and ran for the stairs. Her bare feet moved soundlessly over the thick, moss-green carpet that covered the upstairs hall and the steps themselves, and made scarcely more noise as they encountered the oriental runner and highly polished hardwood floor of the center entrance hall. The front door was unlocked, she discovered as she turned the knob. Jess would never go out and leave the house unlocked. As two females living alone, they were both extra careful about that.<br><br>Had she been no farther away than her own porch, or yard, all this time?<br><br>Grace yanked open the door and burst through the unlatched screen onto the covered front porch. The concrete slabs that made up the porch floor felt cold to her feet. The wicker swing suspended from chains at the far end creaked as it was caught by the wind. The matching white rockers moved too, as if pushed gently back and forth by unseen occupants. A lightning glance around told Grace that her daughter was not there. She ran to the top of the half-dozen brick stairs that led down to the yard.<br><br>"Jessica!" Her hand curled around the cool wrought iron of the banister. Embarrassment at the prospect of waking the neighbors moderated her volume to some degree. Though it was hard to be certain amidst the obscuring shadows, Grace thought the figure heading toward the gate paused at the sound of her voice. Certainly it glanced back. Moonlight glinted briefly on a pale oval face.<br><br>"Jessica Hart, you come back here this instant!" If there was a cross between a hiss and a shout, that was the voice Grace used as she descended the front steps, beckoning imperiously to her daughter.<br><br>Jessica heard, and saw. The stillness of her, and the fact that she continued to look back, told Grace that. Grace was thankful that she didn't need to scream at the top of her lungs to get her message across.<br><br>Although she would have, if necessary.<br><br>Two yards over, the Welch's dog began to bark. It was a Scottie with an unmistakable, high-pitched yip. Someone must have forgotten to let it in for the night, as they sometimes did, to the consternation of all the neighbors.<br><br>Just as Grace reached the brick sidewalk at the base of the steps, Jessica moved. She turned, leaped like a deer over the remaining few feet of lawn, snatched open the gate, and ran headlong down the street.<br><br>Jaw dropping at this blatant act of defiance, Grace needed only the space of a pair of heartbeats to respond. Unconcerned with her bare feet or the fact that she was wearing only her nightgown, Grace pounded across the yard in hot pursuit.<br><br>"Jessica!"<br><br>The grass was firm and faintly prickly underfoot, the ground damp but not overly cold. The scattering of fallen leaves was slippery when stepped on, like magazine pages on carpet. Wood smoke from an afternoon of leaf burning lingered in the balmy night air. She trod on a sharp stick and yelped, but didn't stop. Unbelievably, Jessica was running away from her, fleeing down the road.<br><br>"Jessica!"<br><br>Grace reached the gate at the corner of the yard, jerked it open, and bounded through it. Her right foot came down squarely on something soft and squishy and round and furry. Something that didn't belong in a grassy yard. Something that rolled as she stepped on it.<br><br><i>What</i> . . . Grace thought even as she lost her balance and fell, landing heavily on the asphalt road. The impact to her knees and palms was instantaneous, jarring, and painful. She cried out.<br><br>At the sound, Jessica glanced back, but didn't stop. She had almost reached the bend in the road that would hide her from her mother's sight. Gasping with exertion and pain, Grace could do nothing but gaze furiously after her.<br><br>The fleeing figure ran through a bright patch of moonlight that spilled in a narrow swath across the road. At last it was clearly illuminated.<br><br>With a thrill of disbelief, Grace realized that the person she had been pursuing so desperately was someone she did not know.<br><br>The hip-length dark coat and dark knit watch cap did not belong to Jessica. Jessica was not that tall, or that bulky. Jessica did not move like that. <i>It was not Jessica</i>.<br><br>Whoever it was ran on around the bend, and out of sight.<br><br>It was a long moment before Grace was able to glance away from the spot where the figure had disappeared. The next object that registered with her confused senses was the soft, squishy, furry thing she had stepped on to cause her fall, which now lay just a few inches from her right hand.<br><br>It was a teddy bear.<br><br>Jessica's teddy bear, to be precise, the one she had owned since she was a tiny girl. The one she loved. The one that, up until at least tonight's bedtime when Grace had seen it there as she bade her daughter good night, had been perched on Jessica's bedside table ready to watch over Jess as she slept.<br><br>Now it was lying in the grass beside the road, button eyes staring sightlessly up into the dark night sky.</p><h2>The Guardian</h2><p>Plunge into the world of seen and unseen forces in The Guardian.

But as any Star Wars fan knows, Jabba didn&#39;t appear until the third film, Return of the Jedi. Lucas had hit the technological wall -- he couldn&#39;t craft Jabba the way he wanted, so he simply removed the scene from his initial, ground-breaking movie. Now, two decades later, he has taken that footage -- with a young Harrison Ford portraying a brash Han Solo -- and added Jabba to it. The result is incredible. The hair will stand up on the back of your neck, and you&#39;ll feel twenty years younger as you experience that remarkable thrill all over again.

No one was convinced. He even dragged the reluctant members of the Society up into the mountains to see the evidence for themselves, pointing out the scars on the hard rocks left by glaciation (which some of those present tried to explain away as having been produced by the wheels of passing carriages). Extraordinarily, it would take a further 140 years before the ice age theory was fully proved and understood. John and Mary Gribbin tell the remarkable story of how we came to understand the phenomenon of ice ages, focusing on the key personalities obsessed with the search for answers. How frequently do ice ages occur? How do astronomical rhythms affect the Earth&#39;s climate? Have there always been two polar ice caps? Is it true that tiny changes in the heat balance of the Earth could plunge us back into full ice age conditions? With startling new material on how the last major Ice Epoch could have hastened human evolution, &#34;Ice Age&#34; explains why the Earth was once covered in ice - and how that made us human.</p><p>John Gribbin is the acclaimed author of many popular science books in Penguin, including The Little Book of Science (1999). Mary Gribbin is best known as a writer of science books for young readers. Together the Gribbins have written several science books, including Richard Feynman: A Life in Science (Penguin, 1998).&#34;So you think it&#39;s cold now?

Organized into ten chapters focusing on a single subject (lighting, color, texture), the book breaks down otherwise complex topics in ways that are accessible and easy to absorb. Each chapter begins with a basic overview, followed by room "tours" told through sumptuous photos and explanatory text. Particularly useful are the two-page spreads called "Find Your Style" which help readers determine which approaches&#x2014;Subtle or brave color?

Although always a competent legal and technical writer, the idea muse ignored her completely. It wasn't until she met future friend and partner Cie Adams that things began to click. Her friend's brain was the idea muse's nesting site! Cie was blessed (or some would say cursed) with one or more full book plots a day! Cathy quickly realized where her bread was buttered. She did learn she possessed a skill in writing romance and action scenes, while her partner concocted storylines and richly diverse characters. Within 18 months of the start of their partnership, they had written five books, and now have two accepted for publication! Cathy lives outside of Brady, TX, with her husband, Don, (also a brilliantly gifted idea man for suspense and espionage) and their four dogs.<br><br>C.T. Adams happily resides in Texas with a teenage son and pet cats. Office work provided a living while she pursued the goal of becoming a novelist. Forming the partnership with Cathy was the catalyst that led to publication. Cie provides a wildly vivid imagination, while Cathy's brilliant execution (pun intended, she writes vicious action scenes), editing, and business acumen gives the partnership the impetus to get writing projects off of the "drawing board" and into the hands of the readers. The partners have two books currently accepted for publication. They look forward to a long and happy collaborative relationship, having plans for two multi-book series and several individual works on their way to completion.Hit man Tony Giodone has seen some wacky whack jobs but this takes the cake. Sue Quentin, winner of a huge lottery jackpot, wants him to off her. She is so desperate to get away from her obnoxiously calculating and avaricious family, she feels that death is the only escape. Tony, meanwhile, has made a miscalculation. Ever since he was bitten by one of his targets, he has experienced three days of amnesia at the full moon, during which he turns into a wolf, so he usually locks himself away in a soundproof suite in the Plaza. Fortunately, he wakes up this time to find that Sue is still alive and well. A powerful bout of lovemaking leaves Tony certain that he has found his mate, and he will do anything for Sue, even kill her if that's what she wants. This unusual, artfully constructed, and enticing blend of horror and romance will have wide appeal with its male point of view, intensely sexy love story, and caperlike action. <i>Diana Tixier Herald</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In this new volume Childs uses the book of Isaiah as a case study of the church's endeavor throughout history to understand its Scriptures.<br><br>In each chapter Childs focuses on a different Christian age, using the work of key figures to illustrate the church's changing views of Isaiah. After looking at the Septuagint translation, Childs examines commentaries and tractates from the patristic, Reformation, and modern periods. His review shows that despite an enormous diversity in time, culture, nationality, and audience, these works nevertheless display a "family resemblance" in their theological understandings of this central Old Testament text. Childs also reveals how the church struggled to adapt to changing social and historical conditions, often by correcting or refining traditional methodologies, while at the same time maintaining a theological stance measured by faithfulness to Jesus Christ. In an important final chapter Childs draws out some implications of his work for modern debates over the role of Scripture in the life of the church.<br><br>Of great value to scholars, ministers, and students, this book will also draw general readers into the exciting theological debate currently raging in the Christian church about the faithful interpretation of Scripture.</p><p>Brevard S. Childs (1923&#x2013;2007) was Sterling Professor Emeritus of Divinity at Yale Divinity School.&nbsp;<i><b>Catholic Biblical Quarterly</b></i><br> "Childs has presented a work of great erudition, careful analysis, and remarkable clarity of expression. We owe him a debt of sincere gratitude."<br><br><b>Ellen F. Davis</b><br> "Probably no one but Brevard Childs could have written this lucid, fascinating, and vastly learned account of Christian hermeneutics and exegesis of Isaiah &#x2014; an account best understood as a nonreductionistic 'family history.' Without glossing over tensions and failures, Childs shows how complex is the process of reading the Bible in faith from generation to generation in the church."<br><br><b>Christopher Seitz</b><br> "This is a magisterial volume &#x2014; learned, exhaustive, accessible. Brevard Childs gets to the hermeneutical problem that is ours, in our 'postmodern' instincts, yet whose resolution will come only from attending carefully to the history of interpretation. It risks understatement to say that this book is a towering, timely, unparalleled contribution from a man who has single-handedly held the lantern showing us the way ahead in our difficult days, now by turning his attention to the crucial history of reception of the book of Isaiah. Brilliant and full of insight."<br><br><b>George J. Brooke</b><br> "Once again Brevard Childs has put us in his debt with a splendid and thought-provoking book that is much more than just a history of interpretation. Childs's analytical description of how Isaiah has been handled over two millennia is both a major contribution to our understanding of the many faces of Christian hermeneutics and a timely reminder that all those who use scripture should be keenly aware of their own methods and presuppositions."</p><h2>Ladies Prefer Rogues: Four Novellas of Time-Travel Passion (Berkley Sensation)</h2><p><b>Four of today's most cherished romance novelists prove that when it comes to love, there's no time like the present&#x2014;no matter what century you're in.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Janet Chapman's "Man from the Moon," a young woman encounters a band of 23rd-century warriors on a mission to save mankind.

It is a profoundly rich, subtly delineated series of sketches of self and others (among the latter, internationally famous British actors such as Gielgud and Richardson). With an Introduction by Piers Paul Read.Already a bestseller in England, Guinness's memoir is less autobiography than fond recollections of the many friends ("blessings") he has accumulated in his long theatrical career. In loosely organized chapters, most centered around one of the major influences in his life (e.g., Sybil Thorndike, John Gielgud), Guinness wanders back and forth through time. The threads of Guinness's own career, marriage, and religious searching wind through these chapters in an amusingly self-deprecatory way.

By: Charles Jesse Jones, illustrated By: Colonel Henry Inman: ... who cofounded Garden City, Kansas.</h2><p>Charles Jesse Jones, known as Buffalo Jones (January 31, 1844 &#x2013; October 1, 1919), was an American frontiersman, farmer, rancher, hunter, and conservationist who cofounded Garden City, Kansas. He has been cited by the National Archives as one of the "preservers of the American bison". Early years: Jones was born near Pekin in Tazewell County in north central Illinois, to Noah Nicholas Jones and the former Jane Munden. His father was a farmer and election judge who once hired Abraham Lincoln as an attorney. The second oldest of twelve children, Jones was reared on a farm at Money Creek in McLean County in central Illinois near Bloomington. Jones became involved at an early age with the capture of wild animals and kept several as pets. For two years, he attended Illinois Wesleyan University in Bloomington but withdrew after being stricken with typhoid fever. In 1866, at the age of twenty-two, Jones came to Troy in Doniphan County in the northeastern corner of Kansas, to operate a fruit tree nursery. In 1869, he wed the former Martha Walton, a descendant of naturalist Izaak Walton. The couple had two sons, who died in childhood, and two daughters, Jessie and Olive. Soon, Jones left the tree nursery and headed west to Osborne County in north central Kansas, where he built a sod house and began earning his livelihood by hunting bison and capturing wild horses. These lengthy hunting trips took Jones into West Texas, where he met the famed lawman Pat Garrett (who in 1881 killed the desperado, Billy the Kid) in Fort Sumner, New Mexico Territory. Some accounts place Jones on March 18, 1877, at the Battle of Yellow House Canyon (also called the Battle of Thompson's Canyon) near the future Lubbock, Texas. His success at hunting earned him the sobriquet "Buffalo" Jones. In addition to hunting bison, he tamed buffalo calves and sold them at county fairs. Garden City:On April 8, 1879, Jones, along with John A. Stevens and the brothers William D. and James R. Fulton, founded Garden City in Finney County in southwestern Kansas. Each man homesteaded 160 acres (0.65 km2). The Jones addition lies west of 8th Street. Jones was elected the first mayor of Garden City. In that capacity, he met such western figures as Wyatt Earp and Buffalo Bill Cody. He also became involved in real estate, and occasionally drove a team of buffalo calves through the streets of Garden City as a promotional stunt, a practice still followed twice daily with cattle in the Fort Worth Stockyards in Fort Worth, Texas.[2] Jones promoted Garden City as the county seat and donated land for the first courthouse. He built the Buffalo Jones block on Grant Street, the Herald Building, and the Lincoln and Grant buildings on 8th street, named for Abraham Lincoln and U.S. Grant. His home at 515 North 9th Street is still used as a residence. Jones was the first member from Finney County to the Kansas House of Representatives. He served two interrupted terms, first as an Independent from District 127 (1885&#x2013;1886) and then as a Republican in District 122 (1889&#x2013;1890). He organized four irrigation companies to take water one hundred miles from the Arkansas River to aid in the cultivation of 75,000 acres (300 km2) of land. Jones contracted with the former Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad to build a depot in Garden City. He encouraged the movement of thousands of settlers into the region....

My kids love being able to keep up with the beads at the bottom and I love being able to meditate on the mysteries using the artwork to keep me focused. Please keep the wonderful books coming! -Emily Nielsen We used this book to say our rosary on the day of the March For Life, and the kids sat quiet and engrossed by the lovely artwork, a different painting for each bead of each mystery. Highly recommended. -Cat Hodge I just bought the Joyful Mysteries, my boys (5 &amp; 6yrs) and I have been using it for the past 3 nights at bedtime! In fact, I let them stay up a bit later than usual last night &amp; told them no books, straight to bed! But they insisted we had to see our "Mary Book", so I caved! I love that the pictures really get them to understand each Mystery.... -Vicki Oberle The Joyful Mysteries came Saturday, and we were just blown away by it. Absolutely beautiful. The artwork is stunning, the whole presentation of the mysteries, how to pray the Rosary, the listing of the artwork at the end, all are done with such excellence. -Barbara Allaire</p><h2>Soul Thief: A Demon Trappers Novel (Demon Trappers, 2)</h2><p><p><b>Riley Blackthorne is beginning to learn that there are worse things than death by demon.

An Iowa native, she lives in Atlanta, GA.</p><b>O</b><b>NE</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><i>2018</i><br><i>Atlanta, Georgia</i><br>The Grounds Zero Coffee Shop made the most amazing hot chocolate in Atlanta, maybe even the whole world. It appeared Riley Blackthorne would have to wade through Armageddon to get it.<br>&#x201c;The end is near!&#x201d; a man called out to passersby. He stood at the shop&#x2019;s entrance holding a homemade cardboard sign that proclaimed the same thing. Instead of having a scraggly beard and wearing a black robe like some biblical prophet, he was wearing chinos and a red shirt.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to prepare, missy,&#x201d; he said and shoved a pamphlet toward Riley with considerable zeal. The tract looked remarkably like the one she had in her jacket pocket. Like the one the angel had given her right before she&#x2019;d agreed to work for Heaven to save her boyfriend&#x2019;s life.<br>&#x201c;The end is near!&#x201d; the man shouted again.<br>&#x201c;Is there still time for hot chocolate?&#x201d; Riley asked.<br>The End Times guy blinked. &#x201c;Ah, maybe; I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, good,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d hate to take on Hell without fueling up.&#x201d;<br>That earned her a confused frown. Rather than explain she jammed the tract in her pocket and pushed open the door to the coffee shop as the man went back to exhorting his audience to prepare for the worst.<br>The Grounds Zero didn&#x2019;t look any different from how it did the last time she&#x2019;d been here. The smell of roasted beans hung in the air like a heady perfume, and the espresso machine growled low and deep. Customers tapped on laptops as they enjoyed expensive coffee and talked about whatever was important in their lives. Just like every day. Except&nbsp;...<br><i>Everything is weird now.</i><br>Even buying hot chocolate. That used to be easy: Place order, pay for order, receive hot beverage. No hassles. That didn&#x2019;t appear to be the case today.<br>The barista kept staring at her even as he made the drink, which wasn&#x2019;t a good thing, because he nearly scalded himself. Maybe it was the multiple burn holes in her denim jacket, or the ragged slice down one sleeve that revealed the T-shirt underneath. Or the fact that her long brown hair had a frizzled, been-too-close-to-a-flame look, despite two shampoo sessions and a lot of conditioner. At least she&#x2019;d changed her jeans, or the guy would be staring at all the dried blood. Blood that wasn&#x2019;t hers.<br>&#x201c;I saw you on TV. You&#x2019;re one of them, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; he asked in a shaky voice, brown eyes so wide they seemed to cover most of his face.<br><i>On TV?</i> Riley had no choice but to own up. &#x201c;Yeah, I&#x2019;m a demon trapper.&#x201d; <i>One of the few lucky enough to survive last night&#x2019;s slaughter.</i><br>The guy dropped the ceramic cup on the counter, sloshing some of the brown goodness over the side and onto the saucer. He backed away like Riley had horns coming out of her skull.<br>&#x201c;Whipped cream?&#x201d; she asked, frowning now. Even if the world was ending, hot chocolate had to have that glorious white stuff on top or what was the point? He reluctantly added the topping, keeping his eyes on her rather than the cup. Some of it actually went inside. &#x201c;Chocolate shavings?&#x201d; she nudged.<br>&#x201c;Ah&nbsp;... we&#x2019;re out,&#x201d; he said.<br><i>It&#x2019;s just one creepo guy. No big.</i><br>But it wasn&#x2019;t just him. Other customers stared as she made her way to an empty booth. One by one they looked up at the television screen high on the wall, then back to her, comparing images.<br><i>Ah, crap.</i><br>There, courtesy of CNN, was last night&#x2019;s disaster in glorious color: flames pouring out of the roof of the Tabernacle as demons ran everywhere. And there she was, illuminated by the raging fire, kneeling on the pavement near her injured boyfriend. She was crying, holding Simon in her arms. It was the moment she knew he was dying.<br><i>Oh, God. I can&#x2019;t handle this.</i><br>The saucer in Riley&#x2019;s hand began to quake, dislodging more of the hot chocolate. It&#x2019;d been bad enough to live through that horror, but now it was all over the television in full and unflinching detail.<br>She paused near a booth as a picture of Simon appeared on the screen. It must have been his high school graduation photo, since his white-blond hair was shorter and his expression stone serious. He was usually that way except when they were hanging together; then he&#x2019;d let his guard down, especially when they were kissing.<br>Riley closed her eyes recalling the time they&#x2019;d spent together before the meeting. They&#x2019;d kissed, and he&#x2019;d admitted how much he cared for her. Then a demon had tried to kill him.<br>Riley sank into the booth and inhaled the rich scent of the hot chocolate, using it to push the bad memories away. The effort failed, though it never had in the past. Instead, her mind dutifully conjured up the image of her boyfriend in his hospital bed, tubes everywhere, his face as white as the sheets.<br>Simon meant so much to her. He&#x2019;d been a quiet, comforting presence after her father&#x2019;s death. Losing him so soon after her dad was unthinkable and Heaven had known that. What else could she do but agree to their terms: Simon&#x2019;s life in trade for Riley owing Heaven a favor. A Really Big Favor. Like stopping Armageddon in its tracks.<br>&#x201c;Why me?&#x201d; Riley muttered. &#x201c;Why not someone else? Why not Simon?&#x201d;<br>He was religious, followed all the rules. He&#x2019;d be the perfect guy to keep the world from ending. They could have made the deal with him when he was injured.<br><i>Instead they chose me.</i><br>To Riley&#x2019;s annoyance, the hot chocolate had cooled beyond what was acceptable drinking temperature, but she sipped it anyway. She kept her eyes riveted on the cup&#x2019;s contents, away from the television screen. Someone scraped a chair across the floor to sit at a table, and Riley jumped at the sound, half expecting a horde of demons to pour through the front door at any moment.<br>The cup trembled in her hands, reminding her how close she skated near the edge. Too much had hit her in a short period of time. Too much more and she wouldn&#x2019;t cope.<br><i>I have to find my dad.</i> That she could do. Maybe. Still, it was something she could focus on. It was unlikely his body was buried under the rubble at the Tabernacle, not when a necromancer went to all the effort to summon him from his grave. That&#x2019;s what necros did: they reanimated corpses and sold them to rich people as unpaid servants. By now someone would be lining up to buy Master Trapper Paul Blackthorne, if he hadn&#x2019;t been sold already.<br><i>What is it like to be dead and walking around like you&#x2019;re still alive?</i> Besides the creep factor, it had to be truly weird. Did her dad remember dying? Did he remember the funeral and being buried? Spiky cold zipped down Riley&#x2019;s spine. She had to get her head in the game.<br><i>I&#x2019;ll find him. I&#x2019;ll get him back in the ground, and that&#x2019;ll be the end of it.</i><br>Her eyes wandered back to the television. A different reporter was doing a play-by-play of last night&#x2019;s horror. He had it mostly right&#x2014;the local Trappers Guild had held a meeting at the Tabernacle in downtown Atlanta, just like they always did. In the middle of the meeting the demons had arrived. Then it got bad.<br>&#x201c;Eyewitnesses say that at least two different kinds of Hellspawn were involved in the attack and that the trappers were quickly overwhelmed,&#x201d; the reporter said.<br><i>Three different kinds, but who&#x2019;s counting?</i><br>Riley frowned. The trappers hadn&#x2019;t been overwhelmed. Well, not completely. They&#x2019;d even managed to kill a few of the things.<br>When she went to pick up the cup of hot chocolate, her hands were still shaking. They&#x2019;d been that way since last night and nothing she did made them stop. She downed the liquid in small sips, knowing people were watching her, talking among themselves. Someone took a picture of her with his cell phone.<br><i>Ah, jeez.</i><br>In the background, she could still hear the reporter on CNN. &#x201c;A number of the trappers escaped the inferno and were immediately set upon by a higher-level fiend.&#x201d;<br>The higher-level fiend had been a Grade Five demon who&#x2019;d opened up deep holes in the ground, spun off mini tornadoes, and caused the earth to shake. All in an effort to take out one trapper.<br><i>Me.</i><br>If it hadn&#x2019;t been for Ori, a freelance demon hunter, the Five would have killed her just like it had her dad.<br>&#x201c;We have interviewed eyewitnesses who claim they saw angels last night,&#x201d; the reporter continued. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve had Doctor Osbourne, a professor of religious studies at UC Santa Barbara, review the videos. He&#x2019;s with us here today, via satellite.&#x201d; A solemn gray-haired man appeared on the screen. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your take on this amazing event, Doctor?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve watched the videos, and all that is visible is a circle of incredibly bright light that surrounds the demon trappers. I have colleagues in Atlanta who&#x2019;ve claimed to see angels in your city. They appeared throughout the Bible to Abraham, to Jacob. Sodom and Gomorrah rated two of them. In this case, they were actively protecting the trappers from Hellspawn. I&#x2019;d say that&#x2019;s biblically significant.&#x201d;<br><i>Tell me about it.</i><br>Riley dug in her messenger bag, retrieved a pen, and began a list on a crisp white napkin.<br>Find Dad<br>Bust Holy Water Scam<br>Save the World<br>Buy Groceries<br>Do Laundry<br>As she saw it, if number three on the list didn&#x2019;t work out, the last two weren&#x2019;t going to be an issue.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2011 by Jana Oliver<br></p><h2>Preacher: The Legendary Mountain Man: How It All Began (Preacher/First Mountain Man)</h2><p>An ordinary boy with extraordinary dreams.

Reprint. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>One of the many pleasures of Molly Gloss's extraordinary third novel is watching it repeatedly change shape and direction before your eyes--a feat all the more wonderful since the narrative consists almost entirely of the fictional diaries of one woman. Charlotte Bridger Drummond--an early-20th-century single mother who supports five young sons in the just-tamed wilderness fringe of western Oregon by writing pulp fiction--presents herself as a bluff, free-thinking feminist, the kind of woman who would tumble her youngest son off her lap and onto the floor for whining. When her housekeeper's frail young granddaughter disappears from a logging camp, Charlotte unhesitatingly sets out to join the inept search parties. So, within 90 pages, Molly Gloss (<i>The Dazzle of Day</i> and <i>The Jump-Off Creek</i>) whisks us from pitch-perfect historical fiction to unsentimental lament over the devastation of the "dark and supernatural woods" of the Pacific Northwest to a kind of wild and woolly mystery story.<p> All of this is immensely engaging, mostly because Charlotte herself is such excellent if occasionally astringent company. But the book really catches fire when Charlotte herself gets lost in the woods. The diary continues through the harrowing days of wet, cold, hunger, hope, despair, and then her fantastic rescue by a band of semihuman giants of the deep woods. Introducing the Sasquatch legend into an otherwise scrupulously realistic historical novel might seem like a risky narrative ploy, but Gloss brilliantly pulls it off. Indeed, so deft is her fusing of the fantastic and the actual that by the end, the narrative transmogrifies once more into a profound and troubling meditation on wildness, nature, and human nature. </p><p> <i>Wild Life</i> brings to mind the works of Jean M. Auel, Marilynne Robinson, Ken Kesey (that dank Oregon setting of <i>Sometimes a Great Notion</i>), and more distantly Willa Cather--but the breadth and daring of Gloss's imagination really puts it in a class of its own. In a sense, unifying all of the many strands of this fictional tour de force is a fiercely candid portrait of the artist, an artist who in Charlotte's words fears "coming face-to-face with my Self on the printed page--it would chill me through to the heart," but who does it anyway. <i>--David Laskin</i></p>MOLLY GLOSS is the author of Wild Life, winner of the James Tiptree Award, The Jump-Off Creek, a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award, and The Dazzle of Day, a New York Times Notable Book.

Born in London, Crankshaw was educated in the Nonconformist public school, Bishop&#39;s Stortford College in Hertfordshire. He started working as a journalist for a few months at The Times. In the 1930s he lived in Vienna, Austria, teaching English and learning German (his competent grasp of German caused him to become part of the British Intelligence service during World War II). On his return he went back to write for The Times and began to write reviews-mostly musical-for The Spectator, The Bookman, and other periodicals. Crankshaw wrote around 40 books on Austrian and Russian subjects and after the war began his research in much more depth. Crankshaw&#39;s book on Nazi terror, Gestapo (1956), was widely read and in 1963 he began to produce the ambitious literary works, often on historical or monumental moments in Russian Political history.</p><h2>JFK: The Second Plot</h2><p>The year 2003 marks the 40th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy&#x2019;s death, yet his assassination still remains one of the greatest mysteries of the 20th century. At the heart of the puzzle is the enigmatic figure of Lee Harvey Oswald, who was himself killed by Jack Ruby only days after Kennedy&#x2019;s death. Few people today believe the official explanation that Oswald was the sole assassin. Eyewitness accounts, film shot at the time, and acoustic, medical, and photographic evidence all point to a second gunman, and a second gunman points to the most feared scenario: a conspiracy. But despite the many theories involving the Mafia, the Russians, and the CIA no one has yet come up with a convincing explanation of Oswald&#x2019;s precise role in the President&#x2019;s murder. After three decades of research, Matthew Smith has uncovered a second plot a plot in which Oswald&#x2019;s true role in the assassination is exposed.</p><p>Matthew Smith is a successful scriptwriter, producer and writer.

Franklin Jameson's <i>The American Revolution</i> Considered as a Social Movement was a pioneering work. Based on a series of four lectures he gave at Princeton University in 1925, the short book argued that the most salient feature of the American Revolution had not been the war for independence from Great Britain; it was, rather, the struggle between aristocratic values and those of the common people who tended toward a leveling democracy. American revolutionaries sought to change their government, not their society, but in destroying monarchy and establishing republics, they in fact changed their society profoundly. Jameson wrote, "The stream of revolution, once started, could not be con.ned within narrow banks, but spread abroad upon the land.?</p><br><p> Jameson's book was among the first to bring social analysis to the fore of American history. Examining the effects the American Revolution had on business, intellectual and religious life, slavery, land ownership, and interactions between members of different social classes, Jameson showed the extent of the social reforms won at home during the war. By looking beyond the political and probing the social aspects of this seminal event, Jameson forced a reexamination of revolution as a social phenomenon and, as one reviewer put it, injected a "liberal spirit" into the study of American history. Still in print after nearly eighty years, the book is a classic of American historiography.</p></p><p>&#39;This is a small but highly significant book by one of the first scholars of America...A truly notable book, this is, carefully organized, cut with a diamond point to a finish, studded with novel illustrative materials, gleaming with new illumination, serenely engaging in style, and sparingly garnished with genial humor.&#39; --Charles a.

If you can call being starved, beaten and otherwise tortured living. But not only did Phil Butler survive, he came out of the experience a new man...a war hero, a loving husband, a warrior for peace and justice. Now he is telling his story, a compelling tale about becoming a warrior, from the seeds of his childhood in Oklahoma, the tempering of his character as a POW for 2855 days and nights, and his conscious growth when he returned to the United States. Phil Butler&#39;s story is not only interesting, it is instructive; he defines a path for the willing and the courageous. No, a man - or a woman - doesn&#39;t have to be tortured to be a warrior and it doesn&#39;t even always help. But most people who would evolve to that higher level do so after confronting great demons and daunting tasks. Phil Butler&#39;s account of his journey is part road map, part history, and always an engaging tale.</p><p>Doctor Phillip Butler is a 1961 graduate of the United States Naval Academy and a former light-attack, carrier pilot. In 1965 he went down over North Vietnam where he was captured and spent 2,855 days and nights, almost eight years, as a prisoner of war. He is a highly decorated combat veteran who was awarded two Silver Stars, two Legion of Merits, two Bronze Stars and two Purple Heart medals. After his repatriation in 1973 he earned a PhD in sociology from the University of California at San Diego and became a Navy Organizational Effectiveness consultant. He completed his Navy career in 1981 as a professor of management at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey. Phil then founded Camelot Enterprises, a management seminar, professional speaking and consulting services business. As a professional keynote speaker he told his dramatic and inspirational story of how POW&#39;s were able to survive and succeed. As an organizational development consultant he specialized in team building, leadership development, interpersonal skills, strategic planning, organizational re-structuring and other topics. In 2000 he retired as a traveling professional speaker and consultant. He has been a constant community service volunteer since his repatriation from Vietnam, having served on more than a dozen boards, some of which he chaired. He and his wife Barbara have been volunteer docents at Point Lobos State Reserve for 20 years. He has also been a 20 year peace and social justice activist with Veterans for Peace, having served as their national board chair. He currently chairs the Peace Coalition of Monterey County, a coalition of 21 peace and social justice organizations in Monterey County. He is married and lives in Monterey with his wife, Barbara Baldock, where he enjoys golf, reading and playing his piano.</p><h2>Healing with Homeopathy: The Doctors&#39; Guide</h2><p>In Healing with Homeopathy, Drs Jonas and Jacobs provide guidelines for using homeopathic remedies, real-life cases of miracle cures and frank talk about homeopathy&#39;s limitations.</p><p>For those intrigued with, but understandably confused by, the hoopla surrounding this increasingly popular field of alternative medicine, <i>Healing with Homeopathy</i> is the perfect primer. Homeopathy, an approach to healing that at its core is concerned with stimulating the body's internal healing response, has a 200-year history in Europe and America, colorfully illustrated here. (Its demise in the U.S. was mostly due to heavy regulation and suppression by the American Medical Association after 1846.)<p> The authors, both traditionally trained medical doctors, have witnessed the power of homeopathy for treating digestive disorders, common colds, respiratory ailments, headaches, emotional disturbances, childhood illnesses such as colic, and women's health problems including menstrual cramps and morning sickness. They stress that homeopathy is designed to help the body cure itself, not just a way to alleviate the symptoms of illness like many allopathic treatments. For example, taking Tylenol for a headache will help numb the pain, but won't fix the cause of your headache. The homeopathic treatment of yellow jasmine (gelsemium) or <i>Kali bichromicum</i>, however, gets to the source of the pain, be it sinus pressure or emotional stress. It is this approach that makes homeopathy effective for chronic health conditions. </p><p> Besides covering home treatment for everything from the flu to diaper rash to postpartum depression, the book also includes treatment sources, summaries of scientific studies that measured the percentages of patients who were helped by homeopathy, and a handy chart of symptoms and homeopathic treatments.</p></p><h2>The Siege of Leningrad 1941-1944: 900 Days of Terror</h2><p>small tear on back cover</p><p></p><h2>Elves: The Omnibus (Warhammer Omnibus)</h2><p>An omnibus of tales featuring an iconic race of the Warhammer world<br><br>Defenders of Ulthuan: A story of betrayal and redemption that explores the magical world of the high elves, set against a backdrop of war as the dark elves launch a massive invasion of the elf homeland, Ulthuan.<br>Sons of Ellyrion: As the island of the elves burns with war, the fate of Ulthuan rests on the shoulders of two brothers who must fight for forgiveness and the chance to defend their homeland. <br>Guardians of the Forest: A human knight is plunged into a strange, mystic realm when he joins forces with wood elves who are fighting to defend their forest homeland from marauding beastmen.</p><p>Graham McNeill has written more than twenty novels for Black Library.

She lives in Phoenix, Arizona.The Answer<br><br>The first step to a happy marriage is to understand that all life is governed by law--nature, music, art, and all of the sciences. These laws are immutable. To live in harmony with them produces health, beauty, and the abundant life. To violate them brings ugliness and destruction. Just as unwavering are the laws of human relationships. These laws are in operation even though you may not understand them. You may be happy in marriage because you obey them, or you may be unhappy because you violate them without an awareness of the laws in operation.<br><br>Through ignorance of the laws of marriage relationships, much unnecessary unhappiness exists. We find one woman happy, honored, and loved; and another--no less attractive, no less admirable, no less lovable--neglected, unhappy, and disappointed. Why? This book explains why, for it teaches the laws she must obey if she is to be loved, honored, and adored.<br><br>Fascinating Womanhood<br><br>Fascinating Womanhood will teach you how to be happy in marriage. There are three essentials in reaching the goal:<br><br>1. Love: Since the cornerstone of a happy marriage is love, you will learn how to awaken your husband's love. These teachings apply, no matter what your age or situation. Love is not limited to the young or the beautiful, but to those who have qualities that awaken it.<br><br>If your husband doesn't love you, you are likely doing something to cool his affections, or have lost something which awakens his love. You may have begun marriage lovingly but romance is fading. Why? Could it be that you have changed? Take a good look. In most cases a man stops loving a woman after marriage because she stops doing things which arouse his feelings. When you regain your charming ways, love can be rekindled.<br><br>In winning your husband's love, it isn't necessary for him to know or do anything about it. This isn't to say that he doesn't make mistakes or need to improve, but when you correct your mistakes you bring about a loving response in him. Frequently his response is so remarkable that it exceeds your highest expectations.<br><br>The art of awakening a man's love is not a difficult accomplishment for women because it is based on our natural instincts. However, in our highly civilized life many of our natural instincts have become rusty due to lack of use. You need only to awaken the traits which belong to you by nature.<br><br>2. Self-Dignity: Essential to happiness in marriage is self-dignity. Does your husband ever speak to you harshly, criticize you unduly, treat you unfairly, neglect you, impose on you, or in any way mistreat you? The important thing is not what he does but how you react. Do you shrink back as if struck by a lash? Do you go into your shell? Do you pay him back with a cutting remark? Or, do you fly off the handle with an ugly temper? If you react in any of these ways you will cause yourself unnecessary grief and lessen your husband's love for you.<br><br>No man likes an ugly temper, nor does he want a woman he can walk on, or one who will retreat into her shell and feel sorry for herself. He wants a woman with some spunk--some hidden fire, a woman he can't push around. Some men even admire little spitfires, women who are adorably independent and saucy, whom they can't put down with even the most degrading remark.<br><br>In Fascinating Womanhood the method of handling wounded feelings is called childlike anger, spunk, or sauciness. It will teach you how to handle a man's rough nature without pain, without friction. You can, in a flash, turn a crisis into a humorous situation, so that the man may have the sudden impulse to laugh. Instead of hurting marriage, childlike anger can increase love and tenderness.<br><br>3. Desires: If you are to be happy in marriage your desires must be considered. I am referring to things you want to have, places you want to go, something you want to do, or something you want done for you. This is not to suggest selfish whims, but worthy desires. Unfortunately, you may have gone without these things for years because you didn't know how to motivate your husband to do these things for you.<br><br>As a consequence, his feelings for you have likely diminished. We love whom we serve. If your husband never does anything for you beyond the call of duty, he may lose his love for you. In Fascinating Womanhood you will learn how to obtain the things you need and deserve without causing a marital stir. Your husband will want to do things for you and will love you more because of it.<br><br>Although the teachings focus on building a relationship with your husband, the principles apply in building a relationship with any man--father, brother, son, teacher, student, employer. Take care, however, that you don't use them unrighteously, to win the affections of a married man. You would be guilty of a cruel sin and would destroy another woman's relationship as well as your own. In relationships outside of your marriage, apply them only to eliminate friction and to build harmony and trust.<br><br>The teachings are also helpful to the single mother who is rearing a family without a father present in the home. She becomes the feminine image for her children to view, as essential to boys in developing their manliness as to girls in developing their womanliness. She should also teach them about masculinity by providing them with a male image to associate with--her father, a brother, or another male person.<br><br>Within these pages you will learn principles to follow if you are to be happy, loved, and cherished. The study centers around the ideal woman, from a man's point of view, the kind of woman who awakens a man's deepest feelings of love. Within your reach is the possibility of a happy marriage. You can bring it about independent of any effort on the part of your husband. So, you hold the keys to your own happiness.<br><br>In accomplishing this you lose none of your dignity, influence, or freedom, but gain them, and it is only then that you can play your vital part in this world. The role of a woman when played correctly is fulfilling, fascinating, and full of intrigue. There never need be a dull moment. The practice of this art of womanhood is an enjoyable one, filled with rich rewards, numerous surprises, and vast happiness. Many years of experience teaching thousands of women has proven this to be true.</p><h2>Oscar Wilde: A Biography</h2><p>In this long-awaited bioraphy, Wilde the legendary Victorian - brilliant writer and conversationalist, reckless flouter of social and sexual conventions - is brought to life. More astute and forbearing, yet more fallible than legend has allowed, Wilde is given here the dimensions of a modern hero. Based on fresh material from many hitherto-untapped sources, Ellmann depicts Wilde&#39;s comet-like ascent on the Victorian scene and his equally dramatic sudden eclipse. His Irish background, the actresses to whom he paid court, his unfortunate wife and lovers, his clothes, coiffures, and the decor of his rooms - all are presented here in vivid detail. The saga of his 1882 American tour is recounted with a wealth of new details; also his later impact on the bastions of the French literary establishment. The London of the Nineties, of Whistler and the Pre-Raphaelites, Lillie Langtry and the Prince of Wales, is evoked alongside Paris of the &#34;belle epoque&#34; and the Greece, Italy and North Africa of Wilde&#39;stravels. Ellmann&#39;s definitive critical account of Wilde&#39;s entire oeuvre shows him as the proponent of a radical new aesthetic who was perilously at odds with Victorian society. After his period of success and daring, the fatal love affair with Lord Alfred Douglas is followed by exposure, imprisonment, a few wretched years abroad and death in exile. The tragic end of Wilde&#39;s life leaves the reader with a sense of compassion and grief for the protagonist. This edition make the popular and best selling biography available in paperback for the first time.</p><p>Richard Ellmann capped an illustrious career in biography (his <i>James Joyce</i> is considered one of the masterpieces of the 20th century) with this life of Oscar Wilde, which won both the National Book Critics Circle Award and Pulitzer Prize on its original publication in 1988. Ellmann's account of Wilde's extravagantly operatic life as poet, playwright, aesthete, and martyr to sexual morality is notable not only for the full portrait it gives of Wilde, but also for Ellmann's assessment of his subject's literary greatness; both aims are served by a plethora of quotations from Wilde's own work and correspondence. Wilde straddled the line between the Victorian age and the modern world as he did everything in life ... with impeccable style.The biography sensitive to the tragic pattern of the story of a great subject: Oscar Wilde - psychologically and sexually complicated, enormously quotable, central to a alluring cultural world and someone whose life assumed an unbearably dramatic shape.</p><h2>Cooking With Mrs. Appleyard</h2><p>Kent, Louise Andrews, Gay, Elizabeth Kent</p><p></p><h2>The World the Civil War Made (The Steven and Janice Brose Lectures in the Civil War Era)</h2><p>At the close of the Civil War, it was clear that the military conflict that began in South Carolina and was fought largely east of the Mississippi River had changed the politics, policy, and daily life of the entire nation. In an expansive reimagining of post&#x2013;Civil War America, the essays in this volume explore these profound changes not only in the South but also in the Southwest, in the Great Plains, and abroad. Resisting the tendency to use Reconstruction as a catchall, the contributors instead present diverse histories of a postwar nation that stubbornly refused to adopt a unified ideology and remained violently in flux. Portraying the social and political landscape of postbellum America writ large, this volume demonstrates that by breaking the boundaries of region and race and moving past existing critical frameworks, we can appreciate more fully the competing and often contradictory ideas about freedom and equality that continued to define the United States and its place in the nineteenth-century world. <br><br>Contributors include Amanda Claybaugh, Laura F.

Born on a Celtic isle to eight warrior-witch mothers, Maeve is raised to be as brave as any hero. In her stubborn, enchanting voice, she recounts her perilous quest for the young man, Esus, whose life she once saved from druid sacrifice. Captured and sold to a Roman Madam, Maeve is sustained by a fierce sense of identity, compassion for her sister whores, and her unquenchable love. When she wins her freedom and finds her lost lover, a stormy life begins for both as we follow the Passion story through the eyes of Jesus&#x2019;s partner&#x2014;disciple to no man. Not even the One she loves.

She was ordained as an interfaith minister in the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. She balances writing with a counseling practice.*Starred Review* Anyone not ensconced in a cave lately has heard the rumor that Mary Magdalene was literally the bride of Christ. <i>The Da Vinci </i>Code (2003) popularized the theory sufficiently to make Magdalene pilgrimages big business in France, where she ostensibly established the French royal family. Magdalene fans are in for more surprises in Cunningham's classy, sexy novel, which embraces the Magdalene's reputation for prostitution to the extent of casting her as a sacred whore serving the goddess Isis. For Cunningham, Mary is Maeve, a big, strapping, redheaded Celt sold into slavery in Rome and bought for her ample charms by a renowned <i>domina</i> (i.e., madam). Cunningham's big book is first an absorbing historical novel about down-and-dirty slave life in Rome and then a visionary fantasy about the Magdalene's life as Jesus' gentile wife. Besides Maeve's endearingly slutty second owner, Paulina, few characters participate in both, but in both are characters well known from other texts; for example, in the first the king of the "golden bough," in the second the Virgin Mary, who, holy though she is, is also quite dotty. Cunningham's wild, breakneck style only cements the suspicion that this will be--besides snapped up by Magdalene fans, Celtophiles, feminists, and lovers of a good yarn--controversial.

For anyone interested in the history of publishing in the paperback era, the life of John D. MacDonald is the ultimate primary source.&#x201d; &#x2014;Bill Ott, Booklist.</p><p>&#x201c;From the 1950s through the 1980s, John Dann MacDonald was one of the most popular and prolific writers in America. He was a crime writer who managed to break free of the genre and finally get serious consideration from critics. Sixty-six of his novels and more than four hundred of his short stories were published in his lifetime. When he died in 1986, more than seventy million of his books had been sold.&#x201c;But it was not just sales figures that made MacDonald important. London Times critic H. R. F. Keating selected his 1979 novel, The Green Ripper, as one of the one hundred best mysteries of all time. That same novel won him the American Book Award for the best mystery of the year. His books were translated into at least eighteen languages. Eight of his novels were made into motion pictures, including The Executioners, which became the critically acclaimed Cape Fear.&#x201d; &#x2014;from Chapter One of The Red Hot Typewriter Utilizing the author&#x2019;s many letters and articles, Hugh Merrill brings to life John D.

Now she must keep the entirely unsuitable Mrs. Simpson from seducing the Prince of Wales-and help Scotland Yard by preventing someone from shooting the Prince of Wales instead of quails.</p><p><strong>Rhys Bowen is the Bestselling Author of the Royal Spyness Series, Molly Murphy Mysteries, and Constable Evans. Awarded the Agatha Best Novel Award and nominated for the Edgar Best Novel Rhys's titles have received rave reviews around the globe.</strong><br><b></b><br> Rhys Bowen is a transplanted Brit who now divides her time between California and Arizona. She currently writes two mystery series, the Molly Murphy novels, about an Irish immigrant in 1900s New York City and the lighter Royal Spyness mysteries about a penniless minor royal in 1930s Britain. Her books made bestseller lists, garnered many awards, nominations, and starred reviews.Set in 1932, Bowen's winning third Royal Spyness whodunit to feature Lady Georgiana, a great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria and 34th in line to the English throne (after 2008's <i>A Royal Pain</i>), will please fans of romantic, humorous historicals. Georgie makes an ill-advised attempt to start her own business, before discovering, to her embarrassment, that her definition of a female escort is not the same as that of her clientele. Fearing scandal, the authorities send her off to the family castle in Scotland, where a shooting party that includes the prince of Wales is in residence, with a brief from the Home Office to keep her eyes peeled for threats to the Crown. A series of serious accidents suggests that someone is targeting members of the royal family. The violence soon escalates to murder. The secret behind the attacks has been employed by such other mystery writers as David Dickinson and Robin Paige, but Bowen, who's won both Agatha and Anthony awards, puts a fresh slant on it. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It outlines how the one percent have pulled off an economic and political revolution. By offshoring manufacturing and professional service jobs, US corporations destroyed the growth of consumer income, the basis of the US economy, leaving the bulk of the population mired in debt. Deregulation was used to concentrate income and wealth in fewer hands and in financial corporations "too big to fail." Bailouts remove financial corporations from market discipline and force taxpayers in the US and EU to cover banksters' gambling losses. Environmental destruction has accelerated as economists and corporations refuse to count the exhaustion of nature&#x2019;s resources as a cost, imposing it on the environment and on third parties who do not share in the profits. In much of the Third World the growth model imposes monocultures that deprive people of independence and self- sufficiency The American people do not benefit. In fact, "Globalism," Roberts writes,"is a conspiracy against First World jobs." In addition to offshoring, business leaders are replacing Americans with foreigners in those jobs that they find convenient to retain in the US. Fraudulently claiming that they cannot find enough Americans with science and engineering degrees to fill the jobs, they successfully lobby Congress for work visas for foreigners, who replace American scientific, engineering, and technical employees at substantially lower costs in order to concentrate income and wealth at the top. No one seems to understand that research, development, design, and innovation take place in countries where things are made. The loss of manufacturing means ultimately the loss of engineering and science. The newest plants embody the latest technology. If these plants are abroad, that is where the cutting edge resides. According to a new United Nations Development Program report, the US ranks third among states with the worst income inequality, after Hong Kong and Singapore. Clearly in the US the ladders of upward mobility have been taken down. The US is no longer an opportunity society. There is no economic recovery. "Economists who have spent their professional lives rationalizing &#x201c;globalism&#x201d; as good for America," Roberts writes, "have no idea of the disaster that they have wrought." As a result, the United States has become a failed democracy. Washington has no concern for the economic welfare of citizens or for their civil liberties or those of its European puppet states. Washington serves the interest groups that control it, and these groups are committed to financial fraud, war, and disinformation.

Dr. Roberts has testified before committees of Congress on 30 occasions and was awarded the US Treasury's Meritorious Service Award for "outstanding contributions to the formulation of US economic policy&#x201d;. He was educated at the University of California, Berkeley, and Oxford.The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the rise of the high speed Internet have proved to be the economic and political undoing of the West. "The End Of History&#x201d; caused socialist India and communist China to join the winning side and to open their economies and underutilized labor forces to Western capital and technology. Pushed by Wall Street and large retailers, such as Wal-Mart, American corporations began offshoring the production of goods and services for their domestic markets. Americans ceased to be employed in the manufacture of goods that they consume as corporate executives maximized shareholder earnings and their performance bonuses by substituting cheaper foreign labor for American labor. Many American professional occupations, such as software engineering and Information Technology, also declined as corporations moved this work abroad and brought in foreigners at lower renumeration for many of the jobs that remained domestically. Design and research jobs followed manufacturing abroad, and employment in middle class professional occupations ceased to grow. By taking the lead in offshoring production for domestic markets, US corporations force the same practice on Europe. The demise of First World employment and of Third World agricultural communities, which are supplanted by large scale monoculture, is known as Globalism.<br><br>For most Americans income has stagnated and declined for the past two decades. Much of what Americans lost in wages and salaries as their jobs were moved offshore came back to shareholders and executives in the form of capital gains and performance bonuses from the higher profits that flowed from lower foreign labor costs. The distribution of income worsened dramatically with the mega-rich capturing the gains, while the middle class ladders of upward mobility were dismantled.

Narrated by the younger son, a philosophy professor, the novel, short-listed for the 1993 Booker Prize, is a personal search for answers to the big questions as well as those smaller mysteries that dog even the happiest families. The mother, now afflicted with Alzheimer's disease, was, in her prime, a woman of spirit, an artist who painted portraits, liked to go barefoot, and sang old Broadway songs as she worked. The father, an immigrant from Odessa, is a scientist with his own legacy, less lethal than his wife's genetic inheritance, but no less vitiating--a childhood that was never safe. And those fears have shaped his relationship with his two sons, who resented his apparent lack of imagination and his emphasis on having ``a profession and a pension.'' As his mother nears 60, the narrator observes puzzling changes in her: She no longer paints, and she has difficulty expressing herself--the long, wrenching decline into silence and nothingness has begun. His own marriage breaks down as he becomes obsessively involved in his mother's care. The elder brother, a neurophysician, appears to be more detached, but it's only a protective mechanism, and while their father's death brings the two brothers closer together, it doesn't really help the narrator. As he struggles to find some meaning in his mother's life, his own, and even in the disease (which he suspects he has inherited), he comes to believe that there is a ``pure and heartless reality beyond anything a living soul can comprehend.'' Disease not as a metaphor but as a prescription for living in a book that confronts our worst fears with bracing insight and finely tuned emotion.

She shows how visions of Indians - created not only by tourism but also by anthropologists, collectors of Indian crafts, and modernist writers - have reflected white anxieties about such issues as the value of labor in an industrialized society, racial assimilation, and the perceived loss of cultural authenticity.<br>Dilworth explores diverse expressions of mainstream society's primitivist impulse - from the Fred Harvey Company's guided tours of Indian pueblos supposedly untouched by modern life to enthnographic descriptions of the Hopi Snake dance as alien and exotic. She shows how magazines touted the preindustrial simplicity of Indian artisanal occupations and how Mary Austin's 1923 book, The American Rhythm, urged poets to emulate the cadences of Native American song and dance.<br>Contending that Native Americans of the Southwest still are seen primarily as living relics, Dilworth describes the ways in which they have resisted cultural colonialism. She concludes with a consideration of two contemporary artists who, by infusing their works with history and complexity, are recasting the practices and politics of primitivism.</p><p>Leah Dilworth is assistant professor of English at Long Island University, Brooklyn Campus.With the advent of the railroads, Americans flocked to the Southwest. Visitors were fascinated by the Native cultures, particularly those of the Pueblos, seeing in their "primitive" societies values lost to the mainstream industrialized culture. Dilworth (English, Long Island Univ.) contends that tourists, collectors, and anthropologists alike re-created the image of the Native societies to conform to Euro-American primitivist ideals. In exploring this thesis, Dilworth evaluates turn-of-the-century descriptions of the Hopi Snake Dance and discusses the crucial role played by the Fred Harvey Company in exploitation of these cultures. Arguing that Native realities were marginalized by those who purported to describe them, the author includes a consideration of two contemporary artists, Pueblo poet and sculptor Nora Naranjo-Morse and Hopi photographer Victor Masayesva, who re-create the Native-white exchange from a Native point of view.

He relives the toughness of farm life-plowing the soil with horses, milking cows by hand, putting in long days with heavy, dangerous machinery. He shows us the lighter side too, as he peddles his father's massive rutabaga harvest and gets to know the neighbor boys-and their personal dictionary of cuss words. We meet Frank, Pinky, and Harry, three farmers whose love of music could transform an entire community; Morty, the odd loner whom only a few wild animals could understand; and Fanny, the extraordinary collie whose role on the farm was as important as that of any human being.<br> <br> Withing each story we see just how warm, loving, and supremely educational growing up on a farm could be, for it is here that a young child learns not only how to take the head off a chicken and drive a tractor like a grown-up, but to deal with illness, disability, and death. Resonating with poingnancy and humor, <i>When Chores Were Done</i> contains stories you'll want to read over and over again.

She lives in San Juan, Puerto Rico.Ferr&#x201a;'s second novel in English, and first since her NBA- nominated The House by the Lagoon (1995), creates a colorful family saga as a way to explore the modern political and social history of her native Puerto Rico. The narrator, Elvira Vernet, claims descent from two prominent families whose divergent natures effectively embody contrary strains in the national character. Elvira's mother, Clarissa Rivas de Santillana, grew up among a privileged family made wealthy by its several sugar plantations and given to a dreamlike, contemplative ``faith in inspiration, the importance of aesthetic experience, and love of nature.'' Ferr&#x201a; skillfully traces the consequences of the Santillanas' passivity throughout three generations, focusing on the educational and marital experiences of Clarissa and her four sisters (``the five Ledas of Mount Olympus''), all named after their studious mother's favorite literary heroines. The best of their several stories include the continuing romantic misadventures of ``Tia Lakhm&#x201a;'' and the betrayal of the devotion to poetry of ``Tia Dido'' (when her literary hero Juan Ramon Jimenez comes to lunch, and the scales fall from Dido's eyes forever). As the five daughters attend the university and their circle of acquaintances widens, the family is gradually drawn toward modern industrialism, leftist politics, the US, and the seeds of their ruin. By contrast, the family of Elvira's father, the Vernets, are dominated by patriarch Santiago (``Chaquito'') and his four sons: bluff, extroverted careerists whose commercial ice-plant and cement factory prosper, placing them in the forefront of Puerto Rico's struggles for independence, though nothing can save them from a destiny of violent conflict, infidelity, and suicide. Moving like a firestorm, the novel throws off subsidiary characters and subplots with too-often confusing and occasionally reckless abandon. It's difficult to absorb all the particulars of Ferr&#x201a;'s crowded narrative, and to distinguish among her many characters and their convoluted relationships. Still, one admires Ferr&#x201a;'s ferocious ingenuity and energy as she depicts a society and century in flux. This most demanding of her novels so far is probably also the best. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

That personality reverberates in each of these four dazzling stories.</p><p>A warlock tries to escape Chrestomanci's justice by fleeing to another world-with hilarious results. Cat Chant and Tonino Montana reluctantly join forces when Chrestomanci sends them on a visit that turns suddenly dangerous. The youngest best-selling dreamer needs Chrestomanci's help when she finds she can't dream anymore. And as the gods of an ever-so-orderly world try to destroy the young Sage of Dissolution, Chrestomanci lends a hand.</p><p>Like Chrestomanci himself, acclaimed author Diana Wynne Jones has a graceful flair, which sparkles in the remarkable wit, imagination, and intelligence of these fast-paced tales.</p></p><p>In <i>Mixed Magics</i>, celebrated British fantasy author Diana Wynne Jones has gathered together three previously published short stories and one brand new tale about the inventive enchanter with nine lives, Chrestomanci. Fans of Wynne Jones know that Chrestomanci is the powerful sorcerer responsible for making sure that the magical users of the many worlds that run parallel to ours don't mismanage their spells. In "Stealer of Souls," he is pitted against Master Spiderman, an evil monkey-magician who intends to make himself the most potent enchanter of all worlds by stealing the essence of other sorcerers. In "Carol Oneir's Hundredth Dream," Chrestomanci must discover the reason why Carol, a bestselling dreamer (she bottles her exciting dreams for others to sleep through and enjoy) is having dreamer's block. In "Warlock at the Wheel," Chrestomanci is so influential that he doesn't even have to show up--he sends his agent Kathusa to rescue a bewildered warlock from a little girl and her large dog, who, strangely enough, have taken <i>him</i> prisoner. And, in the most thought-provoking story, "The Sage of Theare," Chrestomanci must help a confused teen realize that questioning the will of the gods is not only healthy but necessary! Each story is, in turn, frightening, thoughtful, funny, and wise. Readers of <i>Charmed Life</i> and <i>The Magicians of Caprona</i> will be delighted to discover that Wynne Jones has brought back some well-loved characters from other Chrestomanci novels to engage in exciting new adventures.

First, in the early days of American slavery, from control by white "masters" who forced slaves to produce children to work for them, and now, from government "solutions" to African American child-bearing like the distribution of the long-term contraceptive Norplant in African American communities.</p><p> Roberts also takes the mainstream feminist movement to task for working mostly for the "negative right" of liberty, that is, the right of women to not have the government involved in their reproductive decision-making. To Roberts this debate, focused mainly on government non-interference, ignores issues especially important to African American women such as access to contraception or reproduction technologies. "Reproductive freedom is a matter of social justice," she says, stating further that it is social inequality, more than any legal interference, that severely limits African American women's ability to choose how and whether to have children.

It is the story of a murder committed on principle, of a killer who wishes to set himself outside and above society. The novel is marked by Dostoevsky's own harrowing experience in penal servitude, and yet contains moments of wild humor. This new edition of the authoritative and readable Coulson translation comes with a challenging new introduction and notes that elucidate many of the novel's most important--and difficult--aspects.</p><p>Mired in poverty, the student Raskolnikov nevertheless thinks well of himself. Of his pawnbroker he takes a different view, and in deciding to do away with her he sets in motion his own tragic downfall. Dostoyevsky&#39;s penetrating novel of an intellectual whose moral compass goes haywire, and the detective who hunts him down for his terrible crime, is a stunning psychological portrait, a thriller and a profound meditation on guilt and retribution."Dostoevsky conceived the idea of Crime and Punishment in the summer of 1865, having lost all his money at the casino, unable to pay his bill or afford proper meals. At the time the author owed large sums of money to creditors, and he was trying to help the family of his brother Mikhail, who had died in early 1864. Projected under the title The Drunkards, it was to deal "with the present question of drunkness ... [in] all its ramifications, especially the picture of a family and the bringing up of children in these circumstance, etc., etc." Once Dostoevsky conceived Raskolnikov and his crime, now inspired by the case of Pierre François Lacenaire, this theme became ancillary, centering on the story of the Marmeladov family. <p>Dostoevsky offered his story or novella (at the time Dostoevsky was not thinking of a novel) to the publisher Mikhail Katkov. His monthly journal, The Russian Messenger, was a prestigious publication of its kind, and the outlet for both Ivan Turgenev and Leo Tolstoy, but Dostoevsky, having carried on quite bruising polemics with Katkov in early 1860s, had never published anything in its pages. Dostoevsky turned as a last resort to Katkov, and asked for an advance on a proposed contribution after all other appeals elsewhere failed. In a letter to Katkov written in September 1865, Dostoevsky explained to him that the work was to be about a young man who yields to "certain strange, 'unfinished' ideas, yes floating in the air"; he had thus embarked on his plan to explore the moral and psychological dangers of the "radical" ideology. In letters written in November 1865 an important conceptual change occurred: the "story" has become a "novel", and from here on all references to Crime and Punishment are to a novel. </p><p>Dostoevsky had to race against time, in order to finish on time both The Gambler and Crime and Punishment. Anna Snitkina, a stenographer who would soon become his second wife, was a great help for Dostoevsky during this difficult task. The first part of Crime and Punishment appeared in the January 1866 issue of The Russian Messenger, and the last one was published in December 1866." - Wikipedia</p></p><h2>The Yiddish Policemen&#39;s Union</h2><p>Hard to find</p><p><p>For sixty years Jewish refugees and their descendants have prospered in the Federal District of Sitka, a "temporary" safe haven created in the wake of the Holocaust and the shocking 1948 collapse of the fledgling state of Israel. The Jews of the Sitka District have created their own little world in the Alaskan panhandle, a vibrant and complex frontier city that moves to the music of Yiddish. But now the District is set to revert to Alaskan control, and their dream is coming to an end. </p><p>Homicide detective Meyer Landsman of the District Police has enough problems without worrying about the upcoming Reversion. His life is a shambles, his marriage a wreck, his career a disaster. And in the cheap hotel where Landsman has washed up, someone has just committed a murder&#x2014;right under his nose. When he begins to investigate the killing of his neighbor, a former chess prodigy, word comes down from on high that the case is to be dropped immediately, and Landsman finds himself contending with all the powerful forces of faith, obsession, evil, and salvation that are his heritage.</p><p>At once a gripping whodunit, a love story, and an exploration of the mysteries of exile and redemption, <em>The Yiddish Policemen's Union</em> is a novel only Michael Chabon could have written.</p><p>Michael Chabon is the bestselling and Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <em>Moonglow </em>and <em>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay,</em> among many others.

Original.</p><p>Melinda Metz and Laura Burns have written dozens of books for teens under many different names including books for the Buffy the Vampire and Roswell series, Vampire Beach, The Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, Camp Confidential, and the Wright and Wong series which was nominated for an Edgar Award. They have also both written for television.<p> <b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> "One Sigourney Weaver and one Will Smith." Liz Ortecho slid two thick burgers onto the table -- one with avocado and sprouts, one with jalape�o peppers and cheese. </p><p> Then she waited. The customers in the booth were obviously tourists. And every tourist who came to the Crashdown Cafe had at least one question about...the Roswell Incident. </p><p> "So is your family from around here?" the guy in the <i>Lost in Space</i> T-shirt asked. The blond woman sitting across from him flipped open a battered notebook and stared at Liz. </p><p> "Yeah," Liz said. "My great-great-great-grandfather inherited a ranch outside town. My family's been in Roswell ever since." </p><p> The woman uncapped her pen. The man cleared his throat. Here it comes, Liz thought. </p><p> "So did any of your relatives ever tell you any stories about, you know, the UFO crash?" the guy asked. </p><p> These two were a total trip. I bet they have every episode of <i>The X-Files</i> on tape, Liz thought. </p><p> "Well..." Liz hesitated. "I guess it would be okay to show you." She pulled a worn black-and-white photo out of her pocket and gently placed it in front of them. "A friend of my grandmother's took this picture at the crash site -- before the government cleaned it up." </p><p> The two tourists leaned over the blurry photo and studied it carefully. </p><p> "Whoa," the woman mumbled. "Whoa." </p><p> "This looks exactly like the alien from the autopsy video," the guy exclaimed. "Same oversized head and small, hairless body. I've got to get it on my Roswell Incident web site." He reached for the photo. </p><p> "You'd be dead by the end of the week." Liz snatched the photo away. "Just because its been more than fifty years since the crash doesn't mean the air force wants the truth exposed. They still want everyone to believe that weather balloon story they used as a cover-up," she explained. </p><p> Liz glanced around the cafe nervously. She wanted to make sure her father wasn't in earshot. If Papa heard her telling this story, he'd rip off her head and feed it to her for breakfast. </p><p> "I shouldn't have shown this to you. Just forget about it, okay? You never saw it." Liz rushed back behind the counter. </p><p> Maria DeLuca shook her head, sending her blond curls flying around her face. "You are so bad." </p><p> "Hey, they'll have a great story to tell when they get home. And I'll have a great tip," Liz answered. </p><p> Maria sighed. "You and your great tips. I've never known such a money-hungry waitress." </p><p> Liz shrugged. "You know how I feel. I need as much money as I can get because --" </p><p> "One day after grad it's <i>adios</i> and <i>hasta la vista,</i> baby," Maria interrupted. "I know, I know You're not going to spend your life in a town that has two movie theaters, one bowling alley, one lame-o comedy club, one even more lame-o dance club, and thirteen alien-theme tourist traps. </p><p> Liz had to smile. Her best friend did an almost perfect impression of her. "I guess I say that a lot, huh?" </p><p> Maria grabbed a dish towel and started wiping down the counter. "Only ten times a day since fifth grade," she joked. </p><p> "If I didn't have five thousand relatives watching me all the time," Liz said, "maybe I could have some fun once in a while." </p><p> She sighed, imagining a life where she didn't have to worry about doing something -- anything -- that would make her large, loving extended family worry about her future. She was the first daughter in her family headed for college, and her family wanted to make sure that she stayed on track. And not turn out like her sister, Rosa. </p><p> Liz pulled a handful of change out of her pocket and dumped it on the counter. </p><p> "Wow," Maria said. "Great tips. Maybe I should get my own picture of a baby doll someone left out in the sun too long." Maria scrunched up her nose. "Though I don't know if I could do that whole 'you'd be dead by the end of the week' thing without cracking up." </p><p> "Just practice in front of the mirror. That's what I did," Liz told her. </p><p> "It would take a lot of practice," Maria complained. "Everyone always knows when I'm lying. My ten-year-old brother is a better liar than <i>me.</i> The guys my mom goes out with never believe me when I say how nice it is to meet them." </p><p> Liz snorted. "Big surprise." She popped open the cash register and traded her change for bills. Thirty-three more dollars for the Hasta la Vista Fund. Thirty-three seventy-three, actually. </p><p> The opening notes of the <i>Close Encounters</i> theme played as the cafe door swung open. Max Evans, tall and blond, with killer baby blues, and Michael Guerin, dark and intense, ambled over to the corner booth in the back. Both were students at Liz and Maria's high school. </p><p> "Of course they sit in <i>your</i> section," Maria grumbled. </p><p> Liz and Maria each covered six of the cafe's flying-saucer-shaped booths. They divided the dining room in half from front to back so they each got a couple of booths by the windows. Those were the most popular. </p><p> "You get the tourists and the cute guys, and I get those two," Maria continued. She jerked her chin toward the booth nearest the door. "They're having some big fight. They just scowl at me every time I get near them." </p><p> Liz glanced at the two men in the booth. One was big and beefy. The other was smaller but muscular. They were leaning across the table toward each other, talking intently. She couldn't hear what they were saying, but they both looked furious. </p><p> "I think you deserve a good table after dealing with those guys. You can take Max and Michael," Liz volunteered. </p><p> Maria narrowed her blue eyes. "Okay, what's going on?" </p><p> Liz wrapped her arm around Maria's shoulders. "You're my best friend. Can't I just do something nice for you out of the goodness of my heart?" </p><p> "Nope." Maria shrugged Liz's arm away. I repeat -- what's going on?" </p><p> "Nothing," Liz insisted. "I just feel like taking a little vacation from all the testosterone junkies." </p><p> Maria raised one eyebrow. "Translation, please." </p><p> "Guys," Liz explained. "I'm so tired of their...guyness." </p><p> "All guys aren't like Kyle Valenti, you know," Maria told her. "Take Alex. He's totally cool." </p><p> Alex Manes <i>was</i> totally cool. Liz could hardly believe she and Maria had only been friends with him for a year. She felt as if she'd known him forever. </p><p> "You're right. Alex is the best. But he doesn't count." </p><p> Maria frowned. "Why not?" </p><p> "'Cause he's <i>Alex,</i>" Liz said with a shrug. "He's not a guy guy. Not like Kyle. You should have seen Kyle after school today. He will not accept the fact that I won't go out with him again. He actually got down on his knees and followed me down the hall with his tongue hanging out, begging. All his friends were watching, laughing like the idiots they are." </p><p> It made Liz wish she knew karate. She could have really given his friends something to laugh about. </p><p> "How romantic. And that classy move didn't convince you to go out with him again?" Maria's voice rose in fake shock. </p><p> "Uh -- that would be <i>no.</i> And I'm not going out with anyone else for a while, either," Liz declared. "I'm going to stay home, rent chick flicks, take bubble baths, and wear comfy old sweatpants." </p><p> Liz was looking forward to it. To be fair, most guys she'd been out with -- not that there had been that many -- weren't losers like Kyle Valenti. Kyle actually had thought Liz would <i>enjoy</i> sitting next to him on the couch watching him play Nintendo. He hadn't even offered her a turn! </p><p> But even with the other guys, there had just been that "sameness" about them. </p><p> "My love life is pathetic," Liz mumbled. "I just need some time to myself, for myself." </p><p> "Well, I can mix you up some great herbal bath oils," Maria offered. "But if you stop dating, there are going to be some very unhappy boys at Ulysses F. Olsen High." </p><p> "Like who?" Liz demanded. </p><p> Maria glanced over at the booth, where Max and Michael were sitting. "Max Evans," she said. </p><p> "Max?" Liz repeated. "Max is my buddy. He's not interested in me like that." </p><p> "Oh, please," Maria shot back. "How could he not be interested? You look like some kind of Spanish princess or something with your long black hair and your amazing cheekbones. And let's not talk about your skin. Do you even know the word <i>zit?</i> Plus you're smart and --" </p><p> Liz held up both hands. "Stop!" </p><p> Maria was the most loyal person Liz knew. If you were her friend, she stuck by you no matter what. And Liz and Maria had been friends since the second grade, when they bonded over a hurt baby bird. </p><p> "Okay, I'll stop," Maria answered. "But believe me, Max Evans is more than interested. He probably has the words <i>Property of Liz Ortecho</i> tattooed on his chest. Max --" </p><p> "Hi, Michael!" Liz said loudly as Michael walked up to the counter. She hoped he hadn't heard any of their conversation. </p><p> "Hey." Michael raked his fingers through his jet black hair, making the top even more spiky. "I was wondering if you had a job application I could fill out." </p><p> It was hard for Liz to picture Michael working in the cafe, busing tables and making change and stuff. It seemed too normal, too ordinary for Michael. He should have a job as a Navy SEAL or something like that. Michael was always joking around, but there was a definite edge to him. </p><p> Liz reached under the counter and pulled out a pad of forms. "We don't have any openings right now. But I'll talk to my father, and as soon as something comes up I'll have him call you." </p><p> "Oh, I think you're going to be having some openings real fast," Michael answered in a serious tone. "Unless your dad likes waitresses who stand around gossiping instead of waiting on tables." He winked. </p><p> Maria threw her dish towel at him. Michael cracked up. </p><p> "I'll go," Maria said. She picked up two menus and followed Michael over to his booth. </p><p> Liz shot a quick glance over at Max -- and found herself staring directly into his bright blue eyes. They were such an unusual shade, strange and beautiful. Not the blue of the sky or of the ocean. </p><p> Max held Liz's gaze for a second, then he looked away. </p><p> Maria wasn't right about Max -- was she? Liz had known Max since third grade. He had been her lab partner since they were sophomores. But they never hung out outside of class. And Liz hadn't picked up on any vibe signaling that Max wanted to be more than friends. </p><p> Liz grabbed the nearest napkin holder and restocked it. What would it be like to go out with Max? He wasn't really her type. He was quiet. And kind of a loner. </p><p> He saw the world in a different way from most people. He said things that made Liz stop and think. Like when those scientists in Scotland cloned that sheep. A lot of people talked about who they would clone if they could -- scientists or athletes or movie stars. But Max was more interested in whether or not the soul could be cloned -- and if it couldn't, what that meant. Spending time with Max definitely wasn't boring. </p><p> Liz wiped a drop of milk off the counter. She moved the ketchup bottle up a fraction of an inch so it was exactly even with the mustard bottle. Then she stole another peek at Max. </p><p> No one could say the boy was homely, that was for sure. If there were a beefcake calendar of Ulysses F. Olsen High hotties, Max would be in it. Tall, blond, buff, with those blue, blue eyes... </p><p> Liz felt her face get hot. It was weird thinking of Max that way. Most of the time she forgot he was certifiably gorgeous. Max was just <i>Max.</i> She couldn't -- </p><p> "I don't want the money tomorrow. I want it now!" </p><p> The angry voice interrupted Lizs thoughts. She jerked her head up and saw everyone in the cafe staring at the men in the booth by the door. The beefy man clenched and unclenched his fists as he glared at the muscular man. </p><p> I'd better go get Papa out of the office, she thought. Their argument looks like it's about to get ugly. </p><p> Liz turned toward the door marked Employees Only. </p><p> "He's got a gun!" Maria screeched. </p><p> Liz spun back toward the dining room. Her heart slammed against her ribs. No. Oh no. That's all she could think. Over and over. </p><p> The muscular man held a gun to the beefy man's head. "You won't need any money if you're dead," he said. His voice was calm. Calm and cold. </p><p> Click. </p><p> The muscular man cocked the gun. </p><p> Liz wanted to run, she wanted to scream for help, but she was paralyzed. Her mouth refused to open. Her legs refused to move. </p><p> The beefy man gave a howl of fury. He launched himself across the table at the muscular man. </p><p> An eardrum-shattering explosion rocked the room. </p><p> Liz flew off her feet. She hit the wall behind her, then slumped to the ground. </p><p> She felt something warm and wet gushing across her stomach, soaking into her uniform. </p><p> "There's so much blood," Liz heard Maria cry. </p><p> But she sounded so far away. </p><p> So far... </p><p> <br> Max sprang up from his seat in the booth. Instantly Michael grabbed him by the arm and jerked him back into his seat. </p><p> "Let go of me," Max cried. "Liz could be dying. What are you doing?" </p><p> "No, what are <i>you</i> doing?" Michael tightened his grip on Max's arm. "Are you planning to heal her in the middle of a restaurant? Why not just send the government an invitation -- hi, I'm here, why don't you come on over and get me?" </p><p> Michael was right. Healing Liz would attract attention -- a lot of attention. But if he let Liz die when he knew he could save her... </p><p> That was just not an option. </p><p> "I'm willing to risk it," he told Michael. </p><p> "<i>You're</i> willing to risk it. But what about me? What about Isabel?" Michael demanded. </p><p> Max stared down at the table. He didn't answer. He couldn't answer. He would risk his own life for Liz. But how could he risk the lives of his sister and his best friend? </p><p> "If the government has proof that one of us exists, they'll know there are more. They won't stop searching until they find us -- <i>all</i> of us," Michael continued. </p><p> "I can't stop the bleeding!" Maria screamed from behind the counter. </p><p> Max's heart slammed against his ribs. Liz was dying! He bolted to his feet. "I'll think of something. I promise," he said in a rush. </p><p> Before Michael could stop him, Max raced to the counter and vaulted over it. Pain filled his heart as he stared down at Liz. He swallowed hard. </p><p> Maria held a thick towel over Liz's stomach. But nothing could stop the blood pouring from the gunshot wound. </p><p> Max heard Liz's father on the kitchen phone, giving the cafe's address to the ambulance. They're going to be too late, Max thought. He knew it. He could see it. </p><p> The halo of color surrounding Liz was usually a warm, rich amber that made Max wish he could wrap himself up in it. But now her aura had turned a dull, muddy brown. And it was growing darker by the second. </p><p> Darker and darker as her life force drained out of her. </p><p> Every person's aura was different, as unique as a fingerprint. But the only time anyone's aura turned black was at the moment of death. </p><p> Max...</p></p><h2>Project Management for the Design Professional: A Handbook for Architects, Engineers, and Interior Designers</h2><p>This revised work discusses the important role of the project manager in architectural, engineering and interior design firms.

What unfolds is a nightmare, a dark world in which David's love is a crime and a disease, a world of anonymous phone calls, crazy letters, and new fears&#x2014;and the inevitable and punishing pursuit of the one thing that remains most real to him: his endless love for Jade and her family.</p><p>Published in 1979 and hailed as "one of the best books of the year" by the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Endless Love</em> is the novel that first established Scott Spencer as "the contemporary American master of the love story" (<em>Publishers Weekly</em>).</p><p> Scott Spencer is the author of nine previous novels, including <i>A Ship Made of Paper</i>, <i>Waking the Dead</i>, and the international bestseller <i>Endless Love</i>.

She is also the author of the critically acclaimed <em>Trout Summer</em> (an ALA Notable Children&#x2019;s Book and Best Book for Young Adults) and the Newbery Honor Book <em>Crazy Lady! </em> She lives in Baltimore, MD.</p>Grade 4-7 This sequel to Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH (Atheneum, 1971), written by O'Brien's daughter, continues the NIMH saga with a focus on the second rodent generation: Timothy, Mrs. Frisby's son, and Racso, son of the rebel rat Jenner. On his way to classes at Thorn Valley, Timothy saves Racso's life but is himself severely injured. Both reach the Utopian colony only to discover that the valley and surrounding farms are to be turned into a tourist lake and campgrounds. Insecure and arrogant when he first arrives, Racso learns more than just how to read. In fact it is he who suggests a plan to save the colonysabotaging the dam site computer. Although the rats' plans fail, the dam opening is postponed by a heroic act of Racso's father. While the continuation of the NIMH story is most welcome, Conly's novel lacks the light touch of O'Brien's work, as well as the richness of character development and description. Timothy, for example, is too perfect a mouse to be very interesting, and the leader Nicodemus is often a tedious moralizer. Racso, on the other hand, is most appealing when he gets into trouble. Mrs. Frisby, Jeremy and Mr. Ages are unfortunately peripheral characters in this story. Conly sets the stage for the next sequel, for one reporter appears to believe that the computer was sabotaged by intelligent rats. Perhaps in the next installment, Racso's joie de vivre will rub off on the other rodents of Thorn Valley.Yvonne A.

This is the tallest fish tale any landlubber has ever heard, and your family will be hooked on this hilarious tribute to America&#39;s Golden Age of Sail.</p><p>Grade 1-4?In this energetic retelling, Metaxas resurrects Stormalong, the legendary New England sea captain. During the hurricane of 1826, a huge baby is washed right into the Widow Stormalong's parlor. He grows by leaps and bounds, showing an increasing skill at all things nautical. At 16, Stormy joins the crew of a clipper ship and becomes famous by wrestling a sea serpent and tying it into knots. Unfortunately, he continues to grow, and one night he rolls over in his sleep and finds himself overboard. He decides to head as far inland as possible and turns to farming. He becomes so homesick, however, that he "...cried the entire Great Salt Lake into existence" before returning to Boston. He negotiates the narrow English Channel by soaping down his ship's sides, which results in the cliffs of Dover turning white. It is his final adventure, however, in which he and his crew beat a steamship in a race, that may turn this tale into a read-aloud hit. The narrator's sailor dialect is easy to read, and adds a touch of authenticity and fun to this much-anthologized yarn. Vanderbeek's shimmering art reflects the larger-than-life aspects of the text, although his color scheme is more reminiscent of tropical waters than the story's New England setting.

Stoller in this pschyodynamic ethnography of adult heterosexual pornography. Their engrossing accounts reveal in rich detail not only the inner workings of &#x201c;the Industry&#x201d; and the fantasies and motivations of its participants but also the relation between this most denigrated of occupations and &#x201c;normal&#x201d; human erotic behavior and attitudes. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Consistently nonjudgmental about the material he presents, Dr. Stoller nevertheless draws provocative conclusions about porn, its practitioners, and its effects on society. Everyone at work on a porn production, he says, uses it as a vehicle for unloading his or her rage against something&#x2015;mores, institutions, laws, parents, females, or males. According to Dr. Stoller, pornography does not exist only to degrade women, there is no reliable evidence that it increases the frequency of rape, and (with the exception of child porn) it does little harm. Pornography, says Dr. Stoller, seems more the result of our changing society than a cause of change; it reflects, more than influences, our values and mores. </p></p><p>Stoller's self-styled "ethnographic" study of heterosexual pornography consists of reprinting transcripts of his interviews with porn actresses, actors, directors and producers. Much of the material has the aura of a hardcore flesh magazine. Affecting a nonjudgmental attitude, he writes in a short concluding chapter that most porn scripts are not "simply anti-female . . . these stories are often full of freedom--women depicted having a marvelous time." Most pornography "does little good and little harm" except for child porn, he avers. A UCLA professor of psychiatry, Stoller qualifies his position in his summary analysis, stating that anger or rebellion against one's parents and society underlies most pornography, that it exploits men as well as women and that a desire to degrade or be degraded is an element of pornography. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Madman</h2><p>If there is a way into madness, logic says there is a way out.

His dream career as a photojournalist became reality when he joined the SoHo Weekly News, a downtown New York City newspaper, in 1973. For several years he covered the city, exploring its every facet - from the underground to the high society - and documenting its political, social and cultural evolution. His photographs, taken during the turbulent 1970s and early 1980s, serve as a lasting record of that era&#39;s resolution of ideas, trends, and movements that had begun in the 1960s.

This childhood life unfolds itself slowly in eight glistening chapters that gradually reveal the most secret of treasures: how Transtr�mer discovered poetry.</p><p><p>Nobel Prize Laureate and beloved Swedish poet <strong>Tomas Transtr�mer</strong> (1931&#x2013;2015) was born in Stockholm and worked as a psychologist. He wrote ten collections of poems that the Nobel Prize Committee praised for their &#x201c;condensed, translucent images that give us fresh access to reality.&#x201d; The best-known Scandinavian poet of the postwar period, and the most widely translated, his other books available in English include&nbsp;<em>Selected Poems 1954&#x2013;1986</em>;&nbsp;<em>The Half-Finished Heaven</em>;&nbsp;<em>For the Living and the Dead</em>;&nbsp;<em>Night Vision</em>; and&nbsp;<em>Windows and Stars</em>. For many years after being seriously debilitated by a stroke, Transtr�mer continued write. He was also an avid pianist and released a recording of classical piano pieces performed with his left hand. Transtr�mer received numerous public recognitions for his poetry including the Neustadt International Prize for Literature, the Bonnier Award for Poetry, Germany&#x2019;s Petrarch Prize, the Bellman Prize, the Swedish Academy&#x2019;s Nordic Prize, the August Prize, and a Lifetime Recognition Award in 2007 from The Griffin Trust. In 2011 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.</p><p><b>Robin Fulton</b>, a Scottish poet and longtime resident of Norway, has been translating Transtr�mer for over thirty-five years.</p>&#x201c;Like so many great poets before him, Transtr�mer is forever reminding us that the world is not what it appears to be; that with mindfulness and close attention, you might get a glimpse of something vast and strange.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>John Freeman, <em>NPR's Monkey See</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The Nobel prize to Mr. Transtr�mer is a momentary defeat for ideology and a great victory for poetry.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Michael Moynihan, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Through his condensed, translucent images, Transtr�mer gives us fresh access to reality.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>The Nobel Prize Committee</strong></p><h2>For the Sick and the Suffering Prayers and Meditation</h2><p>Includes prayers and meditation for the sick and the suffering.</p><p></p><h2>Heritage Recovered The Lydian Treasure</h2><p>A catalogue of 228 pieces of the Lydian Treasure smuggled out of Turkey and finally reached Metropolitan Museum of New York.

Alexander Mikhailovich Rodchenko (1891-1953) was a central figure in the Russian Constructivist art movement; a radical activist, a pioneer of photomontage, a theorist, and a teacher. He was an active force in the organization of the first museums of modern art that arose in Russia in the first years after the Russian Revolution of 1917. Attending art school in 1914 in Kazan was to be a defining influence: that year Russian Futurists performed in the town, and Rodchenko saw their leading figures in action. It transformed his vision and he was still working with Futurist artists and their ideas twenty-five years later. And it was at art school where Rodchenko first met the artist Varvara Stepanova, with whom he collaborated extensively, and who would become his life-long partner. Central in the re-examination of art and its place in society after the Revolution, and in the search for a new culture without the class implications of the past, Rodchenko&#39;s radical approach proposed a new understanding of a constructed, rather than a tastefully composed, culture. This concise, comprehensive and informative work focuses largely on Rodchenko&#39;s graphic work in the form of book jackets, posters and advertising.

Original.</p><p><b>Kat Martin</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of more than twenty novels, including <i>Heartless, The Secret, Perfect Sin, Silk and Steel,</i> and <i>Night Secrets.</i> She is a graduate of the University of California at Santa Barbara, where she majored in anthropology and history. She currently lives in Montana.<p><b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> <i>London,England<br> 1805</i> </p><p> Reckless -- that's what she is. The girl is simply too wild and reckless for any respectable young man to marry." Thin gray eyebrows lifted in disapproval, Lady Dempsey peered through her jeweled lorgnette to examine the red-haired girl standing next to the punch bowl. "There was a time, you know, she was the darling of the <i>ton.</i> Her father must be terribly disappointed." </p><p> "Indeed," Lady Sarah agreed. "Why, the rumors I've heard..." She shook her head. "It's a good thing her mother -- poor dear woman -- isn't alive to see." </p><p> Over the top of a potted palm in the Earl of Winston's ornate Mayfair town house, Clayton Harcourt studied the object of the women's scorn. He knew Kassandra Wentworth, had met her four years ago when she was first introduced into the marriage mart. Now, well on her way to one-and-twenty, Kitt had been on the shelf far too long to be fashionable, and her father, the Viscount Stockton, was determined to bring the matter to an end. </p><p> Clay watched her as he had a dozen times in the past few months, with frank male interest and a faint, mildly disturbing heaviness in his groin. She was an incredible mix of woman and girl, innocently seductive with her lush breasts, big green eyes, and glorious red hair. When she laughed, there was nothing missish about it. The sound rang with a husky note that spoke of blossoming womanhood and a candor he somehow found refreshing. </p><p> Not that he would ever let her know. From the moment they had met, the two of them had been oil and water. As Lady Dempsey said, the girl was far too reckless, too stubbornly independent. What she needed was a man strong enough to take her in hand. </p><p> Unfortunately, since he was definitely not in the market for a wife, he wouldn't be that man. </p><p> "She is quite something, isn't she?" </p><p> Clay recognized the timbre of his father's voice but his eyes remained on the girl. "She's something, all right. Stubborn and willful. Too bloody outspoken for her own good." </p><p> "Yes, she is. Perhaps that is the reason I liked her from the first moment I met her." </p><p> Clay looked over at the man who had sired him, Alexander Barclay, sixth Duke of Rathmore. The father who had been generous in his financial support, in some ways even his affections, but refused to grant him the legitimacy of his name. </p><p> "You've always had an eye for beauty, Your Grace. The girl is certainly that." </p><p> "That and more," the duke agreed. He took a drink of brandy from the snifter he cradled in a still-strong hand. "Stockton wishes to see her wed." </p><p> "I believe you've mentioned that." </p><p> "I suppose I may have done so." </p><p> "And seeing as how you and the viscount are in business together, as well as politically aligned in the House of Lords, you would like very much to please him." </p><p> "I presume you are referring to the fact I suggested you make an offer for her." </p><p> A corner of Clay's mouth curved up. "You may presume that, yes." </p><p> "I like the girl, blast it! For the right man, Kassandra Wentworth would make a very fine wife." </p><p> "I believe you mentioned that as well." </p><p> "Since you are so bloody good at remembering what I mentioned, do you also remember the proposal I made you some months back -- the very lucrative proposal -- concerning the matter of a marriage between the two of you?" </p><p> "How could I forget?" Clay lifted a glass of champagne from a passing silver tray. The servant, in blue and silver livery, disappeared in the crush around them. "You and Stockton are that eager to see her settled?" </p><p> "Dammit, just once, is it possible you might believe I simply have your welfare in mind? You need a wife. Kassandra needs a husband. I believe the two of you would suit very well." </p><p> Clay scoffed. "You're not serious? We can't be alone in the same room without wanting to kill each other." </p><p> The duke's features softened and a look of fond remembrance crept into his eyes. "Your mother and I were that way. We loathed each other on sight -- or tried to convince ourselves we did. We battled the attraction, the incredible pull between us. We wouldn't even admit it to ourselves." He sighed and shook his head. "God, I miss that woman. I've missed her every day since the day she died." </p><p> Clay studied his father's face, still handsome, though the man was over sixty. The duke rarely spoke of Rachael Harcourt, Clay's mother, the woman who was his mistress for more than twenty years. She had died sixteen years ago, when Clay was just fourteen. The memory of the lonely years that followed still lingered, though he kept them neatly locked away. </p><p> His thoughts drifted back to his father and Rachael Harcourt. Was it possible to love a woman that much? If it was, Clay had certainly never experienced the feeling, though he was surely no stranger to lust. He returned his gaze to Kassandra Wentworth and felt the same pull of attraction, the soft tug of desire that she always seemed to stir. </p><p> Rathmore's gaze followed his. "She has spirit, that girl. She would give you strong, intelligent sons." </p><p> "She's wild and headstrong. Someone needs to take her in hand." </p><p> The duke cocked a silver-brown eyebrow. "Are you saying that you, a man of your vast experience with women, aren't up to the challenge?" </p><p> Clay laughed. "Oh, I'm up to it. If she weren't an innocent -- and your friend Stockton's daughter -- she would likely find herself in my bed." </p><p> Rathmore chuckled softly. "So you do find her attractive." He was nearly as tall as Clay with the same wide shoulders and dark brown hair, though the duke's was now dashed with gray. </p><p> "I'm not blind, Your Grace." Clay looked so much like the duke there was no denying his parentage, yet Rathmore had never openly acknowledged him or publicly called him son. As a boy, he'd been resentful. As a man, he understood. Or at least told himself he did. "With all that curly red hair, and skin like fresh cream, the girl is quite lovely. If she only had a disposition to match." </p><p> Rathmore's gaze flicked toward the punch table, where Kassandra stood talking to their host, the stout little Earl of Winston. He laughed at something she said. </p><p> "She's full of fire, I'll grant you that." </p><p> Kitt smiled, her lush mouth parting, showing a row of small white teeth, and a soft lick of heat curled low in Clay's belly. </p><p> "Personally," the duke went on, "I've always rather liked a little fire in a woman." </p><p> Clay made no reply. He liked that, too. Perhaps it was the reason he found Kitt so attractive. But dammit, he wasn't willing to marry the girl just to satisfy his itch to have her. </p><p> Across the way, Kassandra accepted the arm the earl offered and gave him another of her warm, sunny smiles. Turning, she let him lead her away. </p><p> "They're headed for the gaming room," his father said, watching their progress across the crowded floor. "Girl loves to gamble. Your mother did, too. Would have broken a less wealthy man, though she finally learned to play well enough not to lose." </p><p> Clay watched Kitt Wentworth disappear down the hall to Winston's gaming room. Unlike his mother, Kitt had a natural aptitude for cards. She was a damned good player; not as good as he was, of course, but better than most of the men he gamed with at the club. He set his glass down on an ornate silver tray. </p><p> "If you'll excuse me, Your Grace, I think I feel the urge to play a few hands myself." </p><p> This time his father frowned. "May I remind you -- as you, yourself, so cleverly pointed out -- the girl is yet untried. If you have any notion of seducing her, you had better bear that in mind." </p><p> Clay just smiled. He wasn't completely convinced Kitt was as innocent as his father believed. He remembered the night he had stumbled across her at a boxing match in Covent Garden. At first he hadn't realized the young lad staring into the ring with such fascination was a girl. Then he had heard her laughter, noticed the feminine curves outlined by a pair of snug men's breeches, looked behind the gold-rimmed spectacles perched on the end of a very small, slightly freckled nose, and recognized Kassandra Wentworth. </p><p> He had hauled her and her young companion, Lady Glynis Marston, out of there as fast as he could, though Kitt argued all the way, and ushered them safely back home. </p><p> That was three years ago, but she was still just as daring, and a woman who took those sorts of chances -- well, who knew what else she might be willing to do. Unfortunately, whether or not she was a virgin, Kitt was the daughter of a viscount and unwed, which, without marriage, put her well out of his reach. </p><p> And yet Clay kept walking, striding across the noisy salon toward the room down the hall, anticipating a game of cards that was certain to keep him entertained. </p><p> </p><p> Copyright � 2002 by Kat Martin</p></p><h2>Italians,The</h2><p>Sublime and maddening, fascinating yet baffling, Italy is a country of endless paradox and seemingly unanswerable riddles. John Hooper&#39;s marvellously entertaining and perceptive new book is the ideal companion for anyone seeking to understand contemporary Italy and the unique character of the Italians. Looking at the facts that lie behind - and often belie - the stereotypes, his revealing book sheds new light on many aspects of Italian life: football and Freemasonry, sex, symbolism and the reason why Italian has twelve words for a coat hanger, yet none for a hangover.</p><p>John Hooper is Italy correspondent of the Economist and Southern Europe editor of the Guardian and Observer. He has spent more than thirty years as a foreign correspondent, reporting principally from the Mediterranean, but also on the conflicts in Northern Ireland, Kosovo and Afghanistan. His book The Spaniards (later revised under the title The New Spaniards) has established itself as a classic. The Italians is the fruit of more than 15 years based in Italy.What&#39;s not to love? A thoroughly researched, well-written, ageless narrative of a fascinating people * Kirkus * Thanks to his great curiosity, his splendid comparative and analytical perspective, and a fine eye for telling details, John Hooper gets under the skin of a fascinating people in a remarkable and compelling way -- Bill Emmott John Hooper is a supremely able and experienced foreign correspondent who has mastered a particular subgenre of his craft: the detailed and comprehensive study of individual countries... an admirable piece of work, unassuming but authoritative. If Hooper really were a diplomat instead of a reporter, it would surely earn him his knighthood -- Jan Morris * Literary Review * John Hooper refuses to succumb to easy cliche while explaining the best and worst of Italy. Mixing the amusing titbit with the big picture, he provides context for the question that perplexes the occasional visitor: how come a country that has produced Berlusconi, &#34;bunga bunga&#34; parties, the mafia and an extraordinary bureaucracy is still so attractive? -- John Kampfner * The Guardian * Hooper has written a fascinating, affectionate and well-researched study that delivers the tantalising flavour of a country as hot, cold, bitter and sweet as an affogato -- Christian House * The Telegraph * An amusing and engrossing account of a thoroughly irresponsible nation -- Brian Sewell * The Independent * Italy remains the most fascinating of countries, often perplexing and yet always engaging. Hooper does it justice. People who don&#39;t know Italy will find this book a splendid introduction. Those who know and love the country will find much that is new as well as familiar, much that will have them nodding in agreement, some observations that will meet with the response , &#34;not to my mind&#34;. It deserves to sit happily on the bookshelf beside Barzini; and that is high praise -- Allan Massie * The Scotsman * This portrait of a nation is required reading for anyone heading to a Tuscan villa or Puglian beach this summer -- Tom Robbins * Financial Times *</p><h2>Norwegian Wood Limited Edition Box Set</h2><p>A special movie-tie in edition for the long-awaited film release based on this beloved novel by Haruki Murakami: the story of one college student's romantic coming-of-age, a journey to that distant place of a young man's first, hopeless, and heroic love.<br><br>Toru, a quiet and preternaturally serious young college student in Tokyo, is devoted to Naoko, a beautiful and introspective young woman, but their mutual passion is marked by the tragic death of their best friend years before.&nbsp; Toru begins to adapt to campus life and the loneliness and isolation he faces there, but Naoko finds the pressures and responsibilities of life unbearable.&nbsp; As she retreats further into her own world, Toru finds himself reaching out to others and drawn to a fiercely independent and sexually liberated young woman.</p><p>In 1987, when <i>Norwegian Wood</i> was first published in Japan, it promptly sold more than 4 million copies and transformed Haruki Murakami into a pop-culture icon. The horrified author fled his native land for Europe and the United States, returning only in 1995, by which time the celebrity spotlight had found some fresher targets. And now he's finally authorized a translation for the English-speaking audience, turning to the estimable Jay Rubin, who did a fine job with his big-canvas production <i>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</i>. Readers of Murakami's later work will discover an affecting if atypical novel, and while the author himself has denied the book's autobiographical import--"If I had simply written the literal truth of my own life, the novel would have been no more than fifteen pages long"--it's hard not to read as at least a partial portrait of the artist as a young man. <p> <i>Norwegian Wood</i> is a simple coming-of-age tale, primarily set in 1969-70, when the author was attending university. The political upheavals and student strikes of the period form the novel's backdrop. But the focus here is the young Watanabe's love affairs, and the pain and pleasure and attendant losses of growing up. The collapse of a romance (and this is one among many!) leaves him in a metaphysical shambles: </p><blockquote> I read Naoko's letter again and again, and each time I read it I would be filled with the same unbearable sadness I used to feel whenever Naoko stared into my eyes. I had no way to deal with it, no place I could take it to or hide it away. Like the wind passing over my body, it had neither shape nor weight, nor could I wrap myself in it. </blockquote> This account of a young man's sentimental education sometimes reads like a cross between Sylvia Plath's <i>The Bell Jar</i> and Stephen Vizinczey's <i>In Praise of Older Women</i>. It is less complex and perhaps ultimately less satisfying than Murakami's other, more allegorical work. Still, <i>Norwegian Wood</i> captures the huge expectation of youth--and of this particular time in history--for the future and for the place of love in it. It is also a work saturated with sadness, an emotion that can sometimes cripple a novel but which here merely underscores its youthful poignancy. <i>--Mark Thwaite</i>First American Publication <br>This stunning and elegiac novel by the author of the internationally acclaimed Wind-Up Bird Chronicle has sold over 4 million copies in Japan and is now available to American audiences for the first time. It is sure to be a literary event. <br>Toru, a quiet and preternaturally serious young college student in Tokyo, is devoted to Naoko, a beautiful and introspective young woman, but their mutual passion is marked by the tragic death of their best friend years before. Toru begins to adapt to campus life and the loneliness and isolation he faces there, but Naoko finds the pressures and responsibilities of life unbearable. As she retreats further into her own world, Toru finds himself reaching out to others and drawn to a fiercely independent and sexually liberated young woman. <br>A poignant story of one college student's romantic coming-of-age, Norwegian Wood takes us to that distant place of a young man's first, hopeless, and heroic love.</p><h2>Confessions of an Alien Hunter: A Scientist&#39;s Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence</h2><p>Aliens are big in America.

She was six years older than he, notorious for her lovers, and unlikely to give him children, but possessed of the social connections and skills the ambitious young general thought would help him rise in the revolutionary army. He gave "his living reverie, his dream of perfect passion" a new name, Josephine--perhaps hoping it would blot out her unsavory past. Instead, she continued to be promiscuous as well as extravagant, and the marriage soured as Napoleon ascended to first consul and then emperor of the French. Yet he divorced her only in 1810, when political events made it clear he must have an heir. This highly colored biography practically wallows in Josephine's lurid personal life, colored in by luscious descriptions of the period's clothes, food, and amusements. The author, whose many previous books mostly deal with English royalty, does not burden readers with excessive doses of French history; the focus is always on Josephine, whose psychology is discussed at length. Erickson succeeds in making her subject an attractive figure, if hardly an exemplar of moral rectitude. Her book should appeal to those who like their historical biographies titillating and not too taxing. <i>--Wendy Smith</i><p>Praise for the works of Carolly Erickson</p><p> "[She is] one of the most accomplished and successful historical biographers writing in English." --<i>London Times Literary Supplement</i> on <i>Mistress Anne</i></p><p> "She sets the background with skill and confidence, and the woman she portrays against it is a solid and convincing figure." --<i>New York Times Book Review</i> on <i>Mistress Anne</i></p><p> "Carolly Erickson is a most admirable biographer; and this book is highly enjoyable as well as being reliable and acute, indeed, it is popular historical biography at its best." --Christopher Hibbert, <i>London Times</i>, on <i>Mistress Anne</i></p><p> "A book of considerable literary distinction." --<i>Washington Post Book World</i> on <i>Bloody Mary</i></p><p> "This is a masterful performance in biography against all the portraits in film, fiction, and popular history." --<i>Los Angeles Times</i> on <i>Bloody Mary</i></p><p> "Erickson has brought sophistication and richness in a large biography that may become the counterpart to Francis Hackett's standard <i>HenryVIII</i>." --<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> on <i>Great Harry</i></p><p> "Erickson does an extraordinary job in dramatizing [the] period...the spirit of the age." --<i>Los Angeles Times</i> on <i>Great Harry</i></p><p> "I have never enjoyed a historical biography more." --Elizabeth Longford on <i>The First Elizabeth</i></p><p> "A masterpiece of narrative, a story so absorbing that it is as hard to put down as a fine novel." --Edmund M.

Yasodhara tells the story of her own Sinhala family, rich in love, with everything they could ask for. As a child in idyllic Colombo, Yasodhara's and her siblings' lives are shaped by social hierarchies, their parents' ambitions, teenage love and, subtly, the differences between Tamil and Sinhala people; but the peace is shattered by the tragedies of war. Yasodhara's family escapes to Los Angeles. But Yasodhara's life has already become intertwined with a young Tamil girl's...</p><p>Saraswathie is living in the active war zone of Sri Lanka, and hopes to become a teacher. But her dreams for the future are abruptly stamped out when she is arrested by a group of Sinhala soldiers and pulled into the very heart of the conflict that she has tried so hard to avoid &#x2013; a conflict that, eventually, will connect her and Yasodhara in unexpected ways.</p><p>Nayomi Munaweera's <i>Island of a Thousand Mirrors </i>is an emotionally resonant saga of cultural heritage, heartbreaking conflict and deep family bonds. Narrated in two unforgettably authentic voices and spanning the entirety of the decades-long civil war, it offers an unparalleled portrait of a beautiful land during its most difficult moment by a spellbinding new literary talent who promises tremendous things to come.</p></p><p><p>NAYOMI MUNAWEERA was born in Sri Lanka, and grew up in Nigeria. She emigrated with her family to the United States in her early teens, and now lives in Oakland, CA. <i>Island of a Thousand Mirrors</i> won the 2013 Commonwealth Book Prize for the Asian Region and was longlisted for the 2012 Man Asian Literary Prize. It is her first novel.</p><p>one</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>It is 1948 and the last British ships slip away from the island of Ceylon, laboring and groaning under the weight of purloined treasure. On board one such vessel, the captain&#x2019;s log includes the tusks and legs of elephant herds; rubies, emeralds, topaz; fragrant mountains of cinnamon, cardamom, mustard seeds; forests of ebony, teak, and sandalwood; screeching peacocks; caged and pacing leopards; ten-foot-long monitor lizards whipping their razor tails; barrels of fermented coconut toddy; the jewel-encrusted thrones of Kandyan kings; the weapons of Chola warriors; priceless texts in Pali and Sanskrit, Sinhala and Tamil.</p> <p>At the foam-drenched stern, a blue-eyed, walnut-burnt sahib searches for the vanishing island and says to his pale young wife, &#x201c;A shame, really. Such a nice little place.&#x201d;</p> <p>And she, only recently having left Manchester for the colony and now returning in triumph, a husband successfully hunted and captured, says, &#x201c;But so hot! And the mosquitoes! It will be such a comfort to be home again.&#x201d;</p> <p>The Englishman contemplates the meaning of this word, &#x201c;home,&#x201d; remembers decades of waving palms, soft sarongs against his thighs, the quick fingers and lithe embraces of burnt brown bodies. He has not seen the dome of St. Paul&#x2019;s for ten years. On his last visit to the frigid metropolis, he had felt an odd creature, neither fish nor fowl, smirked at by elegant ladies, his skin chaffed, fingers stiff and unable to determine between fish and salad fork. A sort of anger rises in his throat.</p> <p>He tells himself that he will no longer dream of palm trees and sunshine. His wife takes refuge under his arm, her breast knowingly close to his fingertips. She utters a quick, coquettish laugh. She knows she has sufficient charms to distract him from his island memories. He turns his head resolutely away from the fast-disappearing island and toward the other, colder one ahead of him. His eyes are bone dry.</p> <p>Behind the retreating Englishman, on the new nation&#x2019;s flag is poised a stylized lion, all curving flank and ornate muscle, a long, cruel sword gripped in its front paw. It is the ancient symbol of the Sinhala, who believe that they are descended from the lovemaking between an exiled Indian princess and a large jungle cat. A green stripe represents that small and much-tossed Muslim population. An orange stripe represents the larger, Tamil minority.</p> <p>But in the decades that are coming, race riots and discrimination will render the orange stripe inadequate. It will be replaced by a new flag. On its face, a snarling tiger, all bared fang and bristling whisker. If the idea of militancy is not conveyed strongly enough, dagger-clawed paws burst forth while crossed rifles rear over the cat&#x2019;s head.</p> <p>A rifle-toting tiger. A sword-gripping lion. This is a war that will be waged between related beasts.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>My name is Yasodhara Rajasinghe and this is the story of my family. It is also one possible narrative of my island. But we are always interlopers into history, dropped into a story that has been going on far before we are born, and so I must start much earlier than my birth and I must start with the boy who will become my father.</p> <p>As the last British ships slip over the horizon, my seven-year-old father-to-be, Nishan, cavorts on beaches he does not know are pristine. He dives into an ocean unpolluted by the gasoline-powered tourist boats of the future.</p> <p>In the months before the thunderous monsoon, the ocean tugs at his toes, wraps sinuous limbs about his own, and pulls him into its embrace, out until it is deep enough to dive, headfirst, feet overhead, inverted and submerged. Eyes open against stinging salt, he sees coral like a crowded, crumbling city, busy with variously marked, spotted, dotted, striped, lit, pompous, and playful sea creatures. Now and then, he encounters the curious, swiveling eye of a small red octopus emerging from secret passageways. Approached recklessly, the octopus blanches a pure white, and with an inky ejaculation torpedoes away. So he learns to approach slowly, in rhythm with the gently rolling water, until the creature coming to know this stick-limbed biped is lulled enough to allow his quiet presence.</p> <p>Farther out beyond the reef, where the coral gives way to the true deep, at a certain time of day a tribe of flat silver fish gather in their thousands. To be there is to be surrounded by living shards of light. At a secret signal, all is chaos, a thousand mirrors shattering about him. Then the school speeds to sea and the boy is left in sedate water, a tug and pull of the body as comfortable as sitting in his father&#x2019;s outspread sarong being sung to sleep.</p> <p>When he emerges dripping from the sea, it is to find this father, the village Ayurvedic doctor, perched on an upturned catamaran, deep in conversation with the fisherfolk who squat on their heels before him.</p> <p>The fishermen wear sarongs splotched with octopus ink. Their hands are leathered by handling rope, mending nets, wrestling sharks by their tails onto the beach. They are ruthless with the flesh of the creatures they catch, upturning gentle sea turtles in the sand to carve off chunks of the living flesh. The turtles bleed slowly, drip salt tears from the corners of their ancient eyes. In this way the meat stays fresh for days, the fishermen explain. For similar reasons the fishermen grasp just caught octopuses and turn them inside out, exposing delicate internals that flash through cycles of color. Decades later, in America, when my father sees Christmas lights for the first time, he will astound us with the observation that they look just like dying octopuses.</p> <p>The sun drops fast, blazing momentarily crimson on the horizon. Father and son wander home. At the front door, his mother, Beatrice Muriel, waits, a lantern in her hand. In her other hand, she grips the shoulder of Nishan&#x2019;s twin sister, Mala, who by dint of her girlhood is not allowed on beach wanderings. Beatrice Muriel ignores her husband. She is angry that they have spent the day with the fisherfolk, listening to fisher songs, picking up fisher habits, coming home covered in beach sand. It is too dark to bathe, she scolds. Cold well water after the sun has set will result in sneezing and a runny nose. &#x201c;Running here and there, like a savage. One day I will find you up a coconut tree with the toddy tappers. That&#x2019;s the day I will skin you alive. Wait and see if I don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p> <p>As she scolds, she pulls the bones out of fried fish with deft fingers, mixes it with red rice and coconut sambal into balls, which she pops into the mouths of her children: a bird feeding its chicks. Her monologue ceases only when the plate is empty.</p> <p>Afterward, he goes to sleep on the straw mat next to Mala, sea sand frosting his limbs and gritty in his hair and eyelashes, the dark shapes of his parents on either side of them, their breathing soothing him into sleep.</p> <p>His mother, Beatrice Muriel, comes from a prominent southern family peopled with Vincents, Victorias, Annie-Henriettas, Elizabeths, and Herberts in tribute to the former ruling race. Now, after marriage to the Hikkaduwa Ayurvedic doctor, she is the village schoolteacher. In the small classroom, open to the sea breezes, she teaches the children to read, leads them as they chant loudly an English menagerie: &#x201c;Q IS FOR QUAIL! R IS FOR ROBIN! S IS FOR ESQUIRREL!&#x201d; In the sultry afternoons, she teaches them to work numbers so that they will not be cheated when the Colombo buyers come for fish.</p> <p>Seven years before, Beatrice Muriel, at the age of sixteen, married for a year, finds herself bloodless and nauseous. Her new husband examines her tongue, pulls back her eyelids, nods his head, but propriety will not allow him to name her ailment. Three months later, as custom demands, he sends her home to her mother by swaying bullock cart.</p> <p>In the ancestral house, she is fed and pampered, stroked and coddled. When the pains begin, she labors surrounded by the various women of her family. Her mother parts her thighs, whispers endearments and encouragements into her sweating ears.</p> <p>There are the usual hours of sweat-drenched, pushing, ripping pain before a tiny creature slips forth. A boy! The gods have been benevolent! But wait, Beatrice Muriel on her childhood bed is still sweating, still straining and pushing. With a final effort, a great gush of red, another child slips headfirst from salt water into the wide, airy world. The women submerge the child in the waiting basin of water, hoping to reveal some lighter, more appropriately golden skin tone. The water turns hue, but the baby does not, and Beatrice Muriel, taking in the pair, one eggplant hued and the other milk-tea fair, cries, &#x201c;If only it had been the boy who was so dark! This black-black girl! We will never get her married.&#x201d; To which her mother joins, &#x201c;A darkie granddaughter. Such a shade we have never had in our family. Must be from the father&#x2019;s side!&#x201d; There, revealed for all to see, on the skin of this girl, the stain of low-caste origins. Beatrice Muriel, torn and exhausted from birthing, hangs her head in shame.</p> <p>Because by this time what had not been known before the nuptials has since been revealed. Namely, that sometime in the years before seeking out matrimony, the Doctor had paid a visit to the local registrar&#x2019;s office, where he had worked a sort of alchemy. A handsome bribe to replace his family name, Aposinghe, with its fishy associations and marketplace odors, for the princely sounding Rajasinghe. In this way the Doctor, like so many low-caste persons, had escaped the limitations of fate to win both medical training and wife.</p> <p>The back room of the house is the Doctor&#x2019;s dispensary. On the walls, dusty emerald bottles display their variously oily or transparent contents. On the verandah, patients gather each morning. They are fishermen and farmers who often pay in kind. A large thora fish for the health of a child, a pound of paddy rice for an ointment to ease a grandmother&#x2019;s arthritic knees. The Doctor is dedicated to this motley group of patients, but lacks further ambition and is most satisfied walking the beach with his children.</p> <p>Often Beatrice Muriel finds him in conversation with fishermen, toddy tappers, servants, sometimes even the Tamil coolie who comes to empty the latrine buckets each dawn. When she sees him talking to this blackened djinn who smells of shit and carries the stiff-bristled broom with which he performs his inauspicious duties, it takes all her willpower to walk past them, her stiffly held head eloquent in its disapproval.</p> <p>She has been brought up with definite ideas about the value of each thing and person, its significance and appropriate place on a strict hierarchy. She is unable to tolerate this laxity, her husband&#x2019;s inability or indeed conscious decision not to treat each person according to ancient laws. Her anger takes aim for her husband&#x2019;s head through her children&#x2019;s ears.</p> <p>&#x201c;In my father&#x2019;s day, those people kept out of sight. If one of them had come into the village spreading misfortune and bad smells everywhere, he would have been beaten with his shitty broom. This is your father&#x2019;s fault. Talking to these people. Treating them like every other person. If it were up to him, you know what you all would be doing?&#x201d; Big-eyed children attempt to imagine. &#x201c;You would be gathering up shit with that one. Would you like that? Going door to door in the morning emptying out the buckets of kakka with your hands and a small broom?&#x201d; Children shaking their heads emphatically. No, they would definitely not like that.</p> <p>To counter her husband&#x2019;s carelessness, Beatrice Muriel buys thora fish. She boils it slowly and then pours the water on the thirsty earth of the front yard. She sets the dish in front of her family with great festivity. &#x201c;Now they will know what kind of people we are.&#x201d; Outside, the pungent odor rises. Passersby inhale with distended nostrils and know that the family has feasted on the most expensive sea fish.</p> <p>Those less fortunate eat dried fish while the truly destitute fight with the spiny shells of crabs or lobsters. Decades later, my father will find it incomprehensible that Americans crave what in his childhood was considered repugnant fare. He will look at seafood menus with wonder and shake his head at the truly inexplicable nature of human beings.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>One midnight, the singing of bullfrogs is shattered by human pandemonium. Shouting men burst into the house. They grasp a young fisherman by the arms and legs like a heavy sack of rice, heave him onto the Doctor&#x2019;s table where he writhes and sobs. The family, torn from sleep, witnesses the great, medieval lance skewering the boy&#x2019;s kneecap. The beak of a swordfish, the fishermen say. They had hooked the fish, were reeling it in, when it turned and pierced through the wood and knee as cleanly as if it had aimed exactly for this place. They had to saw through the thing&#x2019;s beak to free him while it smashed itself against the catamaran over and over again. One amputation is rewarded by another. The Doctor must saw through flesh and break through bone by the light of a spluttering kerosene lamp. Outside the window, the entire village gathers, an agitated anthill.</p> <p>Afterward, the fisherman is kept in the dispensary, battling infection, drifting between throbbing pain and dreams of the sea. His name is Seeni Banda and it is Nishan&#x2019;s job to feed him and accompany him to the outhouse. In later years, Seeni Banda will acquire his lifelong companion, the three-legged dog, Kalu Balla, who unlike so many of her four-legged colleagues survives the quiet morning train, losing only a leg to the Doctor&#x2019;s merciful knife.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>For Beatrice Muriel, marriage has not been the pleasant idyll she had been brought up to expect. In an astonishingly short time, the pleasant softness of her body melts away, corroded by relentless sun, salt air, and marital dissatisfaction. Overnight she becomes gaunt, her nostrils pinched, her gaze sharp as knives. She develops the schoolteacher&#x2019;s uncanny ability to detect and subdue childish mischief. Nishan must watch his friends being sent to squat at the back of the schoolroom, arms crossed to grasp opposite ears. As they walk home together, these boys say, &#x201c;<i>Aiyo</i>, she has two eyes in the back of her head.&#x201d; And only filial devotion keeps him from replying, &#x201c;<i>Machang,</i> you should see her at home.&#x201d;</p> <p>Because marital disappointment has bred maternal ambition, Beatrice Muriel dreams of the day her son will enter university and reverse the legacy of a father who is content in daydreams and beach wanderings. Daily, she squats over the open flame, her sari pulled up between her knees, and cooks. Into the fish curry she stirs coconut milk and heady perseverance. Into the sambal, she mixes red onion, green chili, and expectation. Under her breath she mutters invocations to protect her son from <i>as-vaha,</i> the poisonous darts of envy thrown by the gaze of those with less illustrious sons.</p> <p>The days of ocean diving, octopus communing, sand-covered sleep become rare. He spends all his time over books that she has gathered. Head bent over the small pool of light that falls from the lantern, he struggles to memorize English poems and mathematical equations, trace winding Sinhala hieroglyphs. His mother sits by him, her fingers quick with needle and thread. She will not go to sleep until he has finished.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>And now leaving Nishan struggling over his books in the seaside village, we journey northward into the smoky realms of Colombo. Just sixty miles away but a world apart. This is the humid and ...</p></p><h2>Got War?: A Doonesbury Book (Volume 23)</h2><p>"Rear Admiral Steve Kunkle, commander of the carrier strike force, grimaced at a <i>Doonesbury</i> comic strip from the <i>Japan Times</i>.

Recipes are divided into four chapters: Seafood, Poultry, Meats and Vegetarian. Luckily, the recipes are more exciting than the mundane section monikers. Salmon and Snow Peas with Ginger-Lime Rice, Chicken and Mushroom Cacciatore with Gnocchi, Spicy Spaghetti and Meatballs and Butternut Squash Risotto with Pistachios are among the tempting entries. Each recipe is accompanied by nutritional analysis (calories, fat, cholesterol, sodium, carbohydrates, fiber, sugar, and protein), but friendly commentary keeps this volume from feeling too clinical. Food is clearly the focus of the book, but appendices on Eating for a Healthy Heart, Meal Planning, Shopping and Risk Factors for Heart Disease make this a useful volume for anyone who has to watch their diet and health carefully.

Also included are his three 'problem plays', Lady Windermere's Fan, A Woman of No Importance and An Ideal Husband, as well as his once-banned Salome and several other little-known but fascinating dramas. H. Montgomery Hyde, an acknowledged expert on Wilde and author of several books on him, provides an introduction to Wilde's life and work with special attention to the composition and performance of the plays."Wilde is to me our only thorough playwright.

This time-traveling adventure story spans centuries and cultures in Lumley's trademark mix of horror and science fiction, much like his internationally-bestselling Necroscope series. Like the Necroscope novels, Khai of Khem is packed with fast-paced action, hair's-breadth escapes, all-consuming love, endless horror, and, in the person of Khai himself, quick wits and bravery in the teeth of danger. <br><br>Khai begins life in ancient Egypt as the son of Pharaoh Khasathut's chief architect. Believing Pharaoh to be a god, Khai is stunned to learn that the supposedly great and wise leader is a shriveled, ancient fossil of a man whose chief desires are to deflower young virgins and achieve eternal life through the powers of his black magicians. When Khai dares to raise a hand to Pharaoh, he is condemned to be a slave.<br><br>Escaping, Khai flees to neighboring Kush where he earns the rank of general in the army of Queen Ashtarta . . . and a place in Ashtarta's bed. In the heat of battle against Pharaoh's armies, Khai is betrayed by his best friend and falls victim to the evil spells of Khasathut's magicians, who send his soul winging centuries into the future. <br><br>In modern America, Khai searches for the reincarnated souls of his love, Ashtarta, and of his betrayer. Khai is amazed by many of the wonders of the modern world-television, air conditioning, and especially guns, bombs, and other weapons. <br>Returning to his own time, Khai uses the technologies he saw in the future to rewrite the past. But will he and Ashtarta be in time to prevent Khasathut from attaining immortality and using newly-gained alien powers to destroy all of Khem and Kush?<br><br>Originally published in the US in mass market in the early 1980s and unavailable for nearly twenty years, <i>Khai of Khem</i> is one of Brian Lumley's most sought-after novels. Tor Books is pleased to bring it to a new generation of Lumley's readers. <br><br></p><p><br>Brian Lumley is the author of the bestselling Necroscope series of vampire novels.

At three o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon, the sun already hung low over the horizon, casting sharp pink light on the clouds above the skyscrapers.<br><br> Cornelia S. Englehart lagged five steps behind her classmate Lauren Brannigan as they walked down the street. School had just ended for the day.<br><br> Lauren wheeled around to face Cornelia, her long blond braids whipping through the air. &#x201c;Come on, Cornelia,&#x201d; she said irritably, as if Cornelia were her annoying little sister. &#x201c;Hurry up.&#x201d;<br><br> Cornelia reluctantly quickened her pace.<br><br> &#x201c;So, what do you want to do this afternoon?&#x201d; Lauren asked without enthusiasm after they had walked several blocks in complete silence.<br><br> Now, in certain circles, Cornelia was renowned for her extreme reserve. Some girls always have a coterie of pretty friends, sisters, and cousins fluttering around them&#x2014;but not her. She spent most of her time alone and hadn&#x2019;t had playmates since nursery school. Party invitations and after-school playdates had become few and far between. And when Cornelia did get asked over to someone&#x2019;s house, she was terribly out of practice and awkward.<br><br> &#x201c;We can do whatever you want,&#x201d; Cornelia answered, her breath forming a misty cloud in the cold air.<br><br> Lauren sighed impatiently. &#x201c;Well, I just got some new American Girl play scripts for Christmas,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Maybe we can dress up and act one of them out.&#x201d;<br><br> Cornelia&#x2019;s heart sank. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never done a play before,&#x201d; she said, longing for her warm bedroom at home, with her armchair and all of her books.<br><br> &#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; Lauren said. &#x201c;My older sister just got a karaoke machine as one of her presents. Why don&#x2019;t we use that?&#x201d;<br><br> What a nightmare, Cornelia thought. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like singing either,&#x201d; she said.<br><br> Lauren lost her patience. &#x201c;What do you like to do, then?&#x201d; she snapped, staring at Cornelia.<br><br> &#x201c;We could play Scrabble,&#x201d; Cornelia suggested. It would give her secret satisfaction to trounce Lauren in the game, for Cornelia knew lots of uncommon words. It was her special weapon.<br><br> &#x201c;That is so boring,&#x201d; said Lauren as she strode down the street. &#x201c;But better than nothing, I suppose.&#x201d;<br><br> They arrived at Lauren&#x2019;s brownstone house and rang the front doorbell. When they heard the sound of footsteps coming toward the door from inside, Lauren whispered to Cornelia, &#x201c;The only reason I invited you over in the first place is because my mother made me.&#x201d;<br><br> She smiled meanly as Cornelia&#x2019;s face turned ashen. At that moment, Mrs. Brannigan yanked the front door open.<br><br> &#x201c;Hello, girls,&#x201d; she cried, clapping her hands together in apparent joy. &#x201c;Come in, come in. It&#x2019;s absolutely freezing out there! Hello, hello, Cornelia! Welcome to our humble home. It&#x2019;s about time you came over and visited us. Ever since I heard that you were in Lauren&#x2019;s class, I have been simply begging Lauren to invite you over to play. And you live so nearby as well.&#x201d; She took the girls&#x2019; coats and stuffed them into the front closet. &#x201c;Follow me, troops&#x2014;I have a snack for you in the kitchen,&#x201d; she shouted as she practically galloped down the front hallway.<br><br> Lauren glared at her guest as she followed her mother to the kitchen. Cornelia trailed after them.<br><br> &#x201c;Sit down, ladies, sit down,&#x201d; Mrs. Brannigan whooped, clattering down some plates, cupcakes, and glasses of milk for the girls. Cornelia, who found Mrs. Brannigan as volatile as a pot of boiling water, warily sat down at the kitchen table. Mrs. Brannigan plunked down in the chair next to her.<br><br> Lauren stomped to the refrigerator. &#x201c;I want Sprite, not milk,&#x201d; she complained. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not five years old, in case you forgot.&#x201d; Of course, she didn&#x2019;t offer Cornelia any soda as she poured herself a huge glass.<br><br> Mrs. Brannigan gave a little hoot. &#x201c;Have whatever you want, dearest, as long as it&#x2019;s not brandy,&#x201d; she said, and smiled coyly at her cleverness. Then she swiveled around and leaned in toward Cornelia as if they were long-lost friends.<br><br> &#x201c;So, my dear,&#x201d; Mrs. Brannigan said. &#x201c;How is that mother of yours?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; Cornelia replied, wishing by now that she were at the bottom of the ocean. The cupcake sat like a wart on the plate in front of her.<br><br> &#x201c;I heard her play in a concert at Carnegie Hall last month,&#x201d; Mrs. Brannigan said. &#x201c;Marvelous, absolutely marvelous! She has such flair, and my goodness, is she gorgeous! Those long, elegant arms! I could just die! I imagine that you play the piano too, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Cornelia.<br><br> &#x201c;What?&#x201d; shrieked Mrs. Brannigan. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t? How can that be? I would think that your parents would insist! Especially since you&#x2019;re their only child, and all of that talent would go to waste if you didn&#x2019;t play too! After all, your father is a famous pianist also, isn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d;<br><br> Cornelia stared at her glass of milk. &#x201c;Yes, he is,&#x201d; she said after a moment. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;ve never met him.&#x201d;<br><br> For the first time since the girls had walked through the front door, the room was utterly silent. Even Lauren stared at Cornelia.<br><br> Mrs. Brannigan shifted uncomfortably in her chair. &#x201c;Ohhh,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I see. Well, that&#x2019;s all right, dear.&#x201d; She patted Cornelia&#x2019;s hand in a fakey, consoling manner.<br><br> Then she went on, &#x201c;In any case, your mother seems so fabulous. I have always wanted to get to know her! She seems very warm. And, you see, I am planning this charity gala&#x2014;a big party&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m sure it would be a big hit if your mother played the piano at it.&#x201d;<br><br> Tears sprang to Cornelia&#x2019;s eyes. Now she understood the invitation to Lauren&#x2019;s house. Believe it or not, this sort of thing had happened to her before. It always astonished Cornelia that adults were willing to make such fools of themselves in front of her just to get the chance to meet her famous mother.<br><br> &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;ll go home now,&#x201d; she said, feeling older than her eleven years. &#x201c;I have a stomachache.&#x201d; She got up and began to walk toward the front door. Lauren looked elated for the first time that afternoon.<br><br> &#x201c;Ohhhh,&#x201d; wailed Mrs. Brannigan, sensing that her mission was in danger. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter, sweetie?&#x201d; She followed Cornelia down the hallway and snatched an envelope from a desk in the foyer.<br><br> &#x201c;Just a second, dear,&#x201d; she cried, handing the envelope to Cornelia. &#x201c;Please give this to your mother. And come back anytime! I mean it&#x2014;absolutely anytime!&#x201d;<br><br> Cornelia put on her coat, marched out the front door, and closed it behind her, sealing Mrs. Brannigan back up inside. Cornelia sighed with relief. Her visit had lasted a grand total of ten minutes, nearly a record high for an after-school social outing.<br><br> She looked at the letter in her hand. &#x201c;To Lucy&#x201d; was scrawled on the front of the envelope. &#x201c;Please call me!&#x201d; was written on the back of it.<br><br> Cornelia dropped it in the gutter and went for a stroll.</p><h2>Chilton&#39;s Guide to Small Engine Repair Up to 6 Hp</h2><p>Chilton&#39;s Guide to Small Engine Repair Up to 6 Hp</p><p></p><h2>Revolution (Nickelodeon: Legend of Korra)</h2><p><i>Legend of Korra</i> continues the epic action begun in <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>!

He is the author of three previous novels featuring Inspector Chen. His work has&nbsp;won&nbsp;the Anthony Award and been a finalist for the Edgar Award (<i>Death of a Red Heroine</i>) and has been chosen as a Booksense selection (<i>When Red is Black</i>). He lives in St. Louis, Missouri.<b>Chapter One</b>&nbsp;<br>Chief Inspector Chen Cao, of the Shanghai Police Bureau, was invited to a mega bathhouse, Birds Flying, Fishes Jumping, on a May afternoon.<br>&nbsp;<br>According to Lei Zhenren, editor of Shanghai Morning, they would have all their worries luxuriously washed away there. "How much concern do you have? / It is like spring flood / of a long river flowing east. This ultramodern bathhouse is really unique. Characteristics of the Chinese brand of socialism. You won't see anything else like it in the world."<br>&nbsp;<br>Lei knew how to persuade, having quoted for the poetry-liking chief inspector three lines from Li Yu, the Southern Tang emperor poet. "Characteristics of the Chinese brand of socialism" was a political catchphrase, which carried a discordant connotation, especially in the context of the unprecedented materialistic transformation sweeping over the city of Shanghai. As it happened, Chen had just read about the bathhouse in an English publication:<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Every weekend night, about two thousand Chinese and several dozen foreigners gather together naked at Niaofei Yuyao--a gigantic bathhouse, where the masses soak in tubs of milk, sweat in the "fire jade heat room," watch movies, and swim in the pool. It's public and legal. After a round of miniature golf (clothing required), you can get a massage (clothing removed) and watch a Vegas-style show (the audience in pajamas, the performers in less than pajamas) . . . <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It took Chen two or three minutes to figure out the exact wording from the Chinese phonetics niaofei yuyao--"birds flying and fishes jumping." The name of the bathhouse actually came from an ancient proverb: The sea so wide for fishes to jump, the sky so high for birds to fly, which meant figuratively "infinite possibilities." Perhaps too pompous a name for a bathhouse, yet a plausible allusion to its size and service. So he responded, "Such a bath may be too luxurious, Lei. I now have a hot shower in my own apartment, you know."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Come on, Comrade Chief Inspector Chen. If you flash your business card, the owner of the bathhouse will come rushing over, barefoot, to welcome you in. A high-flying Party cadre, and a well-published poet to boot, you deserve a good break. Health is the capital for making socialist revolution, as Chairman Mao said long ago."<br>&nbsp;<br>Chen had known Lei for years, first through the Writers' Association, to which both had belonged. Lei had majored in Chinese literature, and Chen, in Western literature. But early on, they had both been state-assigned to their respective jobs, regardless of their own interests. Starting out as an entry-level business reporter, Lei had since enjoyed a steady rise. When Shanghai Morning was founded the previous year, he was appointed the editor-in-chief. Like other newspapers, Shaghai Morning was still under the ideological control of the government but responsible for its own financial welfare. So Lei made every effort to turn the newspaper into a more readable one, instead of one simply full of polished political clich�s. The efforts had paid off, and the newspaper grew rapidly popular, almost catching up with the Wenhui Daily in its circulation.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lei talked about treating Chen--in celebration of the newspaper's success. It was an invitation Chen found difficult to decline. For all these years, Lei had made a point of publishing Chen's poems in his newspapers.<br>&nbsp;<br>But he could not be too cautious, Chen thought, in his position, in the days of guanxi--connections spreading all over the city like a gigantic web. "My treat, Lei," he said. "Last time you bought me a great lunch at Xinya. It should be my turn now."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Tell you what, Chen. I'm writing about the latest Shanghai entertainments. No fun for me to go there alone. So you're doing me a favor. Business expense, of course."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Well, no private room or private service, then."<br>&nbsp;<br>"You don't have to tell me that. It's not a good idea for people like you or me to be seen in those private rooms. Particularly in the heat of another anticorruption campaign."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Yes, it's the headlines again," Chen said, "in your newspaper."<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Niaofei Yuyao turned out to be a six-story sprawling building on Jumen Road. The dazzling lobby, lit with crystal chandeliers, struck Chen more like a five-star American hotel. The entrance fee was two hundred yuan per person, with additional charges for services requested inside, a stolid manager explained, giving each of them a shining silver bracelet with a number attached to it.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Like dim sum," Lei said, "you'll pay at the end of it, with all the services added to your number."<br>&nbsp;<br>A reporterlike young man sidled over, carrying a camera with a long zoom sticking out like a gun. The manager rose to wave his hand in a flurry: "Pictures are not allowed here."<br>&nbsp;<br>Chen was surprised. "If the picture is going to appear in a newspaper, like yours," he said in a whisper, "it may bring in more business."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Well, a large tree brings in a gusty wind against itself," Lei commented, changing into plastic slippers. "This bathhouse doesn't need any more free advertisement, or the city government may feel obliged to check into its incredible business."<br>&nbsp;<br>The pool area was the size of three or four soccer fields, not including the area for women. The water of three large pools shimmered green in the soft light. Majestic marble statues and fountains stood in each of them, imitations of ancient Roman palaces, except for an impressive array of modern water massage appliances along the poolsides. There were also special tubs with signs such as Beer, Ginseng, Milk, and Herbs. The brownish froth in the beer tub formed a sharp contrast to the white ripples over the milk tub. Chen looked into a gauze bag floating in the ginseng tub--expensive if the thick roots it contained were genuine, though he was not so sure of its medical benefit in the hot bathwater.<br>&nbsp;<br>"These tubs are supposed to be effective," Lei said with a grin.<br>&nbsp;<br>"And very expensive too."<br>&nbsp;<br>"The pools alone could have cost millions. A gamble on the boost the WTO accession will deliver to Shanghai--an economic restructuring with waves of overseas capital inflows. China is currently the second-largest destination for foreign investment after the U.S. Soon it will be the largest."<br>&nbsp;<br>Lei was taking an MBA class in the evening. For the new newspaper, he had to know things beyond his major in Chinese literature years earlier.<br>&nbsp;<br>"So you're writing an article about the bathhouse?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Not just about this place, but the latest entertainment trends in general. Eat, drink, bathe, sleep, and whatnot. A middle class is rising up fast in China. They have money, and they need to know how to spend money. As an editor, I have to write what they want to read."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Indeed, pools of wine, woods of flesh," Chen said, echoing a classical description about the decaying Shang dynasty palace, as he stepped into a steaming hot pool.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Oh, much, much more," Lei chuckled in high spirits, "like the Winter Palace in Russia, except it's so warm here, like the spring water. Or like in the late Roman empire."<br>&nbsp;<br>Chen reclined against the poolside, the water massaging his back and purring as if with a collective contentment, including his. He tried to recall the name of the poet Lei had quoted, but without success.<br>&nbsp;<br>"What are you thinking, Chen?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Nothing--my mind is relaxing in a total blank, as you suggested."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Take it easy, Chen, with your new position in the city congress, and with your name as a best-selling poet."<br>&nbsp;<br>To all appearances, Chen had been moving up steadily. His new membership in the Shanghai People's Congress was seen as another step toward his succeeding Party Secretary Li Guohua in the police bureau. But Chen was not so sure about it. The congress was known as a political rubber stamp, and thus city congressman was more of an honorary title. Possibly a compromise more than anything else, Chen knew, for quite a few hard-liners in the Party opposed his further promotion in the bureau, on the ground of his being too liberal.<br>&nbsp;<br>It was true, however, that his poetry collection had enjoyed unexpected success. Poetry makes no money and, in a money-oriented age, its publication was nothing short of a miracle. And it was actually selling well.<br>&nbsp;<br>His thoughts were interrupted by two new bathers flopping down into the water, one short with gray hair and beady eyes, one tall with an aquiline nose and beer-bottle-thick glasses. Apparently, they were continuing an earlier argument.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Socialism is going to the dogs. These greedy, unscrupulous dogs of the Party officials! They're crunching everything to pieces, and devouring all the bones," the short one declared in indignation. "Our state-run company is like a gigantic fat goose, and everyone must take a bite or pluck a feather or two from it. Did you know that the head of the City Export Office demands a five percent bonus in exchange for his export quota approval?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"What can you do, man?" the tall one said sarcastically. "Communism echoes only in nostalgia songs. It's capitalism that's practiced here--with the Communist Party sitting on the top, sucking a red lollipop. So what can you expect of these Party cadres?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Corrupt throughout.

If you grew up in the 1970s, it may have been from a gleefully lusty tour guide named Xaviera Hollander</p><p>In the late 1960s -- that era of sexual chaos, when Playboy Clubs and love-ins were competing for national attention -- a beautiful, intelligent young Dutch secretary named Xaviera de Vries moved to New York, grew swiftly tired of her desk job . . . and soon became the most visible and glamorous madam the city had ever seen. As Xaviera Hollander, she published a shockingly candid account of her life behind the brothel door. <em>The Happy Hooker</em> shot straight to the top of the bestseller lists, sold more than fifteen million copies, and made this enterprising young woman an international phenomenon. </p><p>Thirty years later, these delightfully explicit tales of the '60s and '70s swingers' scene -- including countless jaw-dropping stories of lesbianism, bondage, fetishism, and more -- remain as titillating as ever, charged with the mix of shrewd observation and uninhibited appetite that made Hollander an irresistible storyteller. <em>The Happy Hooker</em> is a classic: the world's greatest book on the world's oldest profession.</p></p><p><p>Xaviera Hollander's first book, <em>The Happy Hooker,</em> was published in 1972; since then it has been translated into fifteen languages and sold millions of copies around the world. Hollander began writing the column <em>Call Me Madam</em> in <em>Penthouse</em> that same year -- a role she fulfills to this day -- and has been named the magazine's most popular columnist. Now a promoter of the arts in her native Holland and the author of more than a dozen books, she divides her time between Spain and Amsterdam.</p>Xaviera Hollander has been writing a Penthouse column for 30 years. She chronicled her life as a "high-class New York madam" in 1972's The Happy Hooker: My Own Story, which now returns to print. Frankly discussing lesbianism, bondage, voyeurism and run-ins with lawyers and the FBI, Hollander's book was an international bestseller. In her new epilogue, Hollander rather questionably attests that although her stories may not be as shocking or taboo now as they were in 1972, "the business of sex [has] a new relevance" since September 11. Regan Books will also publish Hollander's new memoir, Child No More, in June (a review will run in an upcoming issue). <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>On Stranger Tides</h2><p><p> Aboard the <i>Vociferous</i> Carmichael puppeteer John Chandagnac is sailing toward Jamaica to claim his stolen birthright from an unscrupulous uncle when the vessel is captured . . . <i>by pirates</i>!

Bush's "global war on terror" but ended up entrenching extraordinary executive powers, from warrantless surveillance and indefinite detention to military commissions and targeted killings. Then Obama found himself bequeathing those authorities to Donald Trump. How did the United States get here?<br><br>In <i>Power Wars, </i>Charlie Savage reveals high-level national security legal and policy deliberations in a way no one has done before. He tells inside stories of how Obama came to order the drone killing of an American citizen, preside over an unprecendented crackdown on leaks, and keep a then-secret program that logged every American's phone calls. Encompassing the first comprehensive history of NSA surveillance over the past forty years as well as new information about the Osama bin Laden raid, <i>Power Wars</i> equips readers to understand the legacy of Bush's and Obama's post-9/11 presidencies in the Trump era. <br></p><p>Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Charlie Savage is a Washington correspondent for the <i>New York Times </i>and has been covering post-9/11 legal-policy issues since 2003.

After the recapture of Tennessee, Confederate&nbsp;armies under Braxton Bragg and Edmund Kirby Smith conducted a brilliant advance into the deeply divided state of Kentucky. Meanwhile, other Confederate forces under Sterling Price and Earl Van Dorn attempted to recapture the town of Corinth, Mississippi. As the year drew to a close, Bragg&#x2019;s army was involved in a tactical draw at the battle of Stones River. Earl J.

In 1864, this is a bit much for her Boston-bred mother to bear, but Caddie and her brothers are happy with the status quo. Written in 1935 about Carol Ryrie Brink's grandmother's childhood, the adventures of Caddie and her brothers are still exciting over 60 years later. With each chapter comes another ever-more exciting adventure: a midnight gallop on her horse across a frozen river to warn her American Indian friends of the white men's plan to attack; a prairie fire approaching the school house; and a letter from England that may change the family's life forever. This Newbery Medal-winning book bursts at the seams with Caddie's irrepressible spirit. In spite of her mother's misgivings, Caddie is a perfect role model for any girl--or boy, for that matter. She's big-hearted, she's brave, and she's mechanically inclined! <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i><i>Caddie Woodlawn</i>, which has been captivating young readers since 1935, was awarded the John Newbery Medal for the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children. Now it is in a brand-new edition with lively illustrations by Trina Schart Hyman. In her new foreword, Carol Ryrie Brink lovingly recalls the real Caddie, who was her grandmother, and tells how she often "sat spellbound, listening, listening!" as Caddie told stories of her pioneer childhood. Children everywhere will love redheaded Caddie with her penchant for pranks. Scarcely out of one scrape before she is into another, she refuses to be a "lady," preferring instead to run the woods with her brothers. Whether she is crossing the lake on a raft, visiting an Indian camp, or listening to the tales of the circuit rider, Caddie's adventures provide an exciting and authentic picture of life on the Wisconsin frontier in the 1860s. And readers will discover, as Caddie learns what growing up truly means, that it is not so very different today.

"I remember looking down upon the street from the window of our apartment, and watching the people walking back and forth from their homes to their work," he recalls. I clearly remember the expressions of unhappiness on their faces and thinking to myself, 'There must be more to life than this.'" Masters' father died of a heart attack when Roy was fifteen. In 1948, Roy left England for South Africa, where he worked as a diamond cutter for a little over a year. At age 24, Masters married his wife, Ann, and eventually settled down in Houston, Texas, where he established the Institute of Hypnosis. In 1961, Roy had become aware, as a result of his work with hypnosis, that the reason why he was so successsful with his patients was that he was actually DE-hypnotizing them.

Focusing on the 1990s dynamics of militarization and polarization that resulted in genocide, Uvin reveals how aid enterprises reacted, or failed to react, to those dynamics. By outlining the profound structural basis on which the genocidal edifice was built, the book exposes practices of inequality, exclusion, and humiliation throughout Rwanda.</p><p>Peter Uvin is the Henry J. Leir Professor of International Humanitarian Studies at the Fletcher School, Tufts University. He received his doctorate in international relations from the Institut Universitaire de Hautes Etudes Internationales, University of Geneva. He has been a Research Associate Professor at the Watson Institute of International Affairs, Brown University, and has taught at New Hampshire College and the Graduate School of Development Studies, Geneva. For the last 20 years, he has worked periodically in Africa as a development practitioner and consultant, recently collaborating with UNDP, the OECD, and Belgian, Dutch, Danish, and British bilateral agencies. His book, <i>Aiding Violence: The Development Enterprise in Rwanda</i>, won the 1999 African Studies Association Herskovits Award for the most outstanding book on Africa."A very well researched, well-thought through, astonishing, most upsetting book about the 1994 Rwanda genocide. This book should be obligatory for anybody, African as well as non-African, concerned with the continent."<br><br>"This book should be read by everyone involved in development. For those with some knowledge of Rwanda, reading it is nothing short of a cathartic experience. Much of what Peter Uvin has distilled so carefully and passionately from the Rwandan experience is also painfully relevant for other parts of the world."<br><br>"Paradigm-rocking... simply must be required reading for anyone who desires to set foot in an African nation, no matter how noble or lofty their goals."<br><br>"An invaluable anatomy of the way development aid to Rwanda before the genocide contributed to what took place - essential reading for anyone with a tender conscience and a strong stomach."</p><h2>A Multicultural Reader (Collection Two) Teacher Guide (Many Voices Literature Series)</h2><p>A complete teacher&#39;s guide and resource tool, including reproducible activity sheets for use with the matching student text.

Used books may not include companion materials, may have some shelf wear, may contain highlighting/notes, may not include CDs or access codes. 100% money back guarantee.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, March 2010</strong>: In her witty and wise debut novel, newcomer Helen Simonson introduces the unforgettable character of the widower Major Ernest Pettigrew.&nbsp; The Major epitomizes the Englishman with the "stiff upper lip," who clings to traditional values and has tried (in vain) to pass these along to his yuppie son, Roger. The story centers around Pettigrew's fight to keep his greedy relatives (including his son) from selling a valuable family heirloom--a pair of hunting rifles that symbolizes much of what he stands for, or at least what he thinks he does. The embattled hero discovers an unexpected ally and source of consolation in his neighbor, the Pakistani shopkeeper Jasmina Ali. On the surface, Pettigrew and Ali's backgrounds and life experiences couldn't be more different, but they discover that they have the most important things in common. This wry, yet optimistic comedy of manners with a romantic twist will appeal to grown-up readers of both sexes. Kudos to Helen Simonson, who distinguishes herself with <em>Major Pettigrew's Last Stand</em> as a writer with the narrative range, stylistic chops, and poise of a veteran. <em>--Lauren Nemroff</em><br>Helen Simonson is an Englishwoman who spent her teenage years in a small village in East Sussex, near Rye.

Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. In economics, &#34;Knightian uncertainty&#34; is risk that is immeasurable, impossible to calculate. Knightian uncertainty is named after University of Chicago economist Frank Knight (1885-1972), who distinguished risk and uncertainty in his work &#34;Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit&#34;: &#34;Uncertainty must be taken in a sense radically distinct from the familiar notion of Risk, from which it has never been properly separated.... The essential fact is that &#39;risk&#39; means in some cases a quantity susceptible of measurement, while at other times it is something distinctly not of this character; and there are far-reaching and crucial differences in the bearings of the phenomena depending on which of the two is really present and operating.... It will appear that a measurable uncertainty, or &#39;risk&#39; proper, as we shall use the term, is so far different from an unmeasurable one that it is not in effect an uncertainty at all.&#34; Knight&#39;s works remains a classic text to this day.</p><p>A timeless classic of economic theory that remains fascinating and pertinent today, this is Frank Knight&#39;s famous explanation of why perfect competition cannot eliminate profits, the important differences between &#34;risk&#34; and &#34;uncertainty,&#34; and the vital role of the entrepreneur in profitmaking. Based on Knight&#39;s PhD dissertation, this 1921 work, balancing theory with fact to come to stunning insights, is a distinct pleasure to read.FRANK H. KNIGHT (1885-1972) was a graduate of the University of Tennessee where he received a Bachelor of Science degree and a Master of Arts degree. He then pursued his doctorate in Economics at Cornell University, studying under Professors Alvin Johnson and Allyn Young. This was where he completed his dissertation Cost, Value and Profit in 1916 which formed the basis of his later book Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit. Knight then joined the faculty of the University of Chicago where he eventually became chair of the Department of Economics. In this role, Knight was an early leader of what came to be known as the &#34;first&#34; Chicago school of economics. He was a prolific writer and had a great deal of influence on a generation of economists.</p><h2>Judas&#39;s Mother: A story for every mother who feels responsible for the choices of her children</h2><p>A Parable Freeing Maternal Guilt WHAT JUDAS&#39;S MOTHER KNOWS ABOUT MATERNAL GUILT AND THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON CHILDREN, ALL MOTHERS NEED TO KNOW Is Maternal Guilt Causing You To . . .

Mary moves from a position of prestige, through guilt and shame, and finally to redemption, returning to public life as a wise teacher for others, including mothers of our own time.

Inscribed by author on half title. Sections Include? Rocket Summer, The Earth Men, The Fire Balloons, etc. etc. Hardcover with original dust jacket, not price clipped with light shelfwear to corners and ends of jacket.</p><p>From "Rocket Summer" to "The Million-Year Picnic," Ray Bradbury's stories of the colonization of Mars form an eerie mesh of past and future. Written in the 1940s, the chronicles drip with nostalgic atmosphere--shady porches with tinkling pitchers of lemonade, grandfather clocks, chintz-covered sofas. But longing for this comfortable past proves dangerous in every way to Bradbury's characters--the golden-eyed Martians as well as the humans. Starting in the far-flung future of 1999, expedition after expedition leaves Earth to investigate Mars. The Martians guard their mysteries well, but they are decimated by the diseases that arrive with the rockets. Colonists appear, most with ideas no more lofty than starting a hot-dog stand, and with no respect for the culture they've displaced. <p> Bradbury's quiet exploration of a future that looks so much like the past is sprinkled with lighter material. In "The Silent Towns," the last man on Mars hears the phone ring and ends up on a comical blind date. But in most of these stories, Bradbury holds up a mirror to humanity that reflects a shameful treatment of "the other," yielding, time after time, a harvest of loneliness and isolation. Yet the collection ends with hope for renewal, as a colonist family turns away from the demise of the Earth towards a new future on Mars. Bradbury is a master fantasist and <i>The Martian Chronicles</i> are an unforgettable work of art. <i>--Blaise Selby</i></p>8 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Two in the Bush</h2><p>This work chronicles Gerald Durrell&#39;s search to uncover the different methods of conservation throughout New Zealand, Australia and Malaya.</p><p></p><h2>Desert Days, Desert Nights</h2><p>Through meticulously detailed illustrations, this visually dynamic survey contrasts day and night in five of North America&#39;s prominent deserts-the Chihuahuan, the Great Basin, the Mojave (including Death Valley), the Painted, and the Sonoran-and highlights the unique animals, plants, and geological formations of each.

By the author of The Hidden Jesus. 75,000 first printing.</p><p>Donald Spoto, best known for his Hitchcock bio <i>The Dark Side of Genius</i>, gets past Jackie's dazzling mythic exterior, revealing beneath her white gloves the ominous nicotine stains that led to her early death, gently removing those sunglasses to peek into her soul. Though he, too, must rely on the kindness of anonymous sources, Spoto is relatively skeptical about the dishiest dirt. And because he's an ex-monk and theology professor, he can deal with her religious, intellectual side. She was a superb editor for a third of her life, and Spoto gives her sharp wit its due.<p> Thus, for Jackie's alleged defloration in a Paris elevator, consult <i>All Too Human</i>, and for her alleged beddings of Brando, Sinatra, Beatty, and Bobby Kennedy, read <i>Jackie After Jack</i>. Spoto paints a more restrained Jackie. Sure, she frolicked in moonlit Mayan pools in 1968 with a married ex-JFK cabinet member, but Spoto says she never slept with Bobby, that JFK's Marilyn Monroe fling was a one-night stand, and that Jackie demanded that he take pity on the suicidal actress. Jack and Jackie were kindred: "Each endured a lonely and difficult childhood with emotionally distant mothers and philandering fathers ... each had cultivated a certain solitude." Jack was cold, amoral, uncultured; Jackie nudged him on civil rights, regaled Niebuhr and Nehru, brought art and mind to the White House: "Underneath a veil of lovely inconsequence, she concealed ... an all-seeing eye and a ruthless judgment." Spoto makes their last months--when, ironically, they found real love for one another--as poignant as the moment she found his skull in her hand. </p><p> From the self-doubting kid whose vile mother talked her out of accepting <i>Vogue</i>'s Prix de Paris to the self-possessed editor of <i>Dancing on My Grave</i> and <i>A Cartoon History of the Universe</i>, Spoto's Jackie is a plausible character one wishes one could have known. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>DONALD SPOTO, who earned his Ph.D. degree from Fordham University, is the author of definitive biographies of, among others, Alfred Hitchcock, Tennessee Williams, Laurence Olivier, Marlene Dietrich, Marilyn Monroe, and Ingrid Bergman.

We look at pictures of a bale wall being raised and immediately think: I could do that! Straw bale houses are easy to build, inexpensive, super energy efficient, environmentally friendly, attractive, and - most of al l - can be designed to match the builder's personal space needs, aesthetics, and budget. It's no wonder that straw bale houses are growing in popularity. <p>Most straw bale books do a great job enticing us with beautiful photographs and "selling" the idea of straw-bale building - but they don't adequately address the most critical issues faced by bale house builders. In <i>Straw Bale Building</i>, professional bale builders Peter Mack and Chris Magwood lead the potential builder through the entire process of building a bale structure, tackling all the practical issues; from how to find and choose bales; developing sound building plans; costs; roofing; electrical, plumbing, and heating systems; building code compliance and working with building inspectors; and special concerns for builders in northern climates. </p><p>For those who do not see their lives and their values reflected in "standard" homes, Straw Bale Building offers a wide variety of aesthetic and building options, from multi-storey luxury to elegant simplicity. Over 100 professionally illustrated drawings, plus b&amp;w photos and building plans provide an abundance of creative and practical ideas for novice and experienced builders alike. </p><p>Down-to-earth and complete, <i>Straw Bale Building</i> makes the remarkable benefits of straw bale building available to anyone bitten by the straw bale "bug."</p><p></p><p><b>Peter Mack</b> and <b>Chris Magwood</b> are professional bale house builders.

So why is it illegal to appear naked in public? Nudity has always been paradoxical. In modern consumer culture, it is actively encouraged in some contexts, but criminal or deviant in others. Images of nudity are everywhere. Advertising uses nudity to sell everything from housing loans to appliances, perfume to cars. Nudity has, in fact, become the latest fashion. This is not surprising. Advertising and fashion need a constant stream of novelty and there&#39;s nothing so new as nudity, the oldest fashion of all. Aside from being big business, nudity is a legal and moral minefield, the object of psychological study, and a mundane fact of everyday life. We alternately think of it as a perversion and a state of absolute innocence. Why does nudity mean so many contradictory things, and why is it treated so differently in different contexts? Drawing on a wealth of examples from popular culture, literature, philosophy and religion, as well as first-hand interviews, Nudity: A Cultural Anatomy goes deep into the naked underworld to answer these questions. Barcan encounters morticians, nudists, strippers, nurses, tattooists, artists and makers of pornography. She demonstrates that ordinary people, popular culture and high philosophy are all sources of wisdom about the naked body. Nudity is one of the most fundamental metaphors in the Western tradition - indeed, it is a metaphor for human nature itself - and yet this book is one of the first to explore its paradoxes in depth. Barcan&#39;s mission is to shine a light on a topic that has been largely ignored, even within cultural studies, despite its ability to titillate, shock or entertain. From pubic hair fashions through to a Royal &#34;full monty,&#34; Nudity: A Cultural Anatomy is a fascinating blend of meaningful minutiae and big philosophical questions about the most unnatural state of nature in the modern West.</p><p>Ruth Barcan is Lecturer in the department of Gender Studies, University of Sydney.<p>&#x201c;I've met a lot of folks that think a lot about nudity, but none understand it as well as Ruth Barcan. [This book] is...fascinating...the first of its kind. It goes deep inside nudity, picks it apart, and shines light on its complexitites. I was amazed.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Annie Sprinkle, Nude Performer turned Sexologist</i></p><p>&#x201c;Ruth Barcan's brilliant study of the social meanings of nudity is at once learned, witty, and incisive. To be nude is never to be naked: this book ranges broadly across philosophy, religion, literature and popular culture to tell us why, in a lucid analysis of our divided and complex status as human beings.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>John Frow, University of Edinburgh</i></p><p>&#x201c;This book is excellent and of the highest standard in terms of scholarly discussion and exposition; it is also very lively, entertaining, and superbly written. The author claims that the book is rather 'quirky'--and it is, indeed, distinctly offbeat. It is also incredibly illuminating of fundamental questions about humanity and embodiment.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Jo Entwistle, University of Essex and co-editor of Body Dressing</i></p></p><h2>Here Am I Lord Send Somebody Else</h2><p>Got excuses?

In this book he profiles a very dark character indeed: a woman for whom neither her life nor her fantasies ever got beyond her sad, narrow world of severe men, twisted religious ideas, beatings, sexual jealousy, horror fiction and movies, and obsessive housecleaning. She had several husbands, one of whom she killed, until she ended up as a single mother with two boys and three girls. Then she began to torture and kill the girls, one after another, as they became old enough that their beauty made her angry.

Without fail, every year since it's publication in 1995, the reorders on this title pick up dramatically right before Mother's Day. Every year we reprint it, just before Mother's Day. It's a great book, and I'm glad it reaches new audiences because it has a lot to say about the darker side of the revered role of the mother; and it "sells-through", which means the stores don't have to return it because customers buy enough of them. But somehow I envision these out of control computers churning out reorders based on the title alone," thinking" that it's a delightful little book honoring Moms.

The storm had been building since morning, silver mist giving way to driving rain, gusts off the sea now blowing the hedges and trees almost horizontal. The stone walls that had seemed so magical when she&#x2019;d first arrived now seemed dark and menacing. <br><br>From the plane yesterday morning, Honor had been awed by the green, by the emerald grass and hedgerows and trees. Her three daughters had gazed down, excited and hoping they could see their father&#x2019;s sculpture from the sky. He had written them letters about Ireland, and about the West Cork farmhouse he had found for them to stay in, and how he&#x2019;d built his latest work on the very edge of a cliff overlooking the sea. They had fought to open the letters when they came, and be the one to read them out loud, and sleep with them under their pillows.<br><br>&#x201c;There it is!&#x201d; Regis, fourteen, had cried out, pointing at a crumbling castle.<br><br>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s there...&#x201d; twelve-year-old Agnes had said, crowding her sister to point out the window. Square green fields ran along the coast, each dotted with tiny white farm buildings. Stone towers and ruined castles seemed to crown every high hill.<br><br>&#x201c;They all look like the pictures he sent,&#x201d; Cecilia, just seven, had said. &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter which house it is, as long as he&#x2019;s in it. Right, Mom?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right, sweetheart,&#x201d; Honor had said, sounding so much calmer than she&#x2019;d felt. <br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be just like home, Mom,&#x201d; Agnes had said, forehead pressed to the plane&#x2019;s window. &#x201c;A beach, and stone walls...only now we&#x2019;ll be on the other side of the Atlantic, instead of home in Black Hall. It&#x2019;s like going across a mirror...&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Look at all that green,&#x201d; Cecilia had said.<br><br>&#x201c;Just like our green fields of home,&#x201d; Agnes had said, unconsciously echoing the lyrics of a song her aunt used to sing to her.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the first thing you&#x2019;re going to do when you see Daddy?&#x201d; Regis had asked, turning to peer at Honor. There was such a challenge in her daughter&#x2019;s face&#x2013;almost as if she knew how troubled her mother felt.<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s going to hug and kiss him,&#x201d; Agnes said. &#x201c;Right, Mom?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m going to do, too!&#x201d; Cece said.<br><br>&#x201c;The first thing I&#x2019;m going to do,&#x201d; Regis said, &#x201c;is ask him to show me his sculpture. It&#x2019;s his biggest one yet, and it&#x2019;s right at the edge of the highest cliff, and I want to climb up on top and see if I can see America!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t see America across the Atlantic Ocean, can you, Mom?&#x201d; Cece asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be able to see it, I swear I will,&#x201d; Regis said. &#x201c;Dad said he could see it, so why wouldn&#x2019;t I be able to?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your father was speaking figuratively,&#x201d; Honor said. &#x201c;He meant he could see it in his mind, or his heart...the dream of America that our ancestors had when they left Ireland.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And Daddy&#x2019;s still dreaming,&#x201d; Cece said.<br><br>Cece had counted the days till this trip. Agnes prayed for his safety. And Regis followed in his footsteps. Although she didn&#x2019;t want to be an artist, she did want to live life on the edge. Over the past year she had been delivered back to the Academy by the police twice&#x2013;once for diving off the train bridge into Devil&#x2019;s Hole, and once for climbing to the top of the lighthouse to hang the Irish flag.<br><br>Instead of being upset, John had gone straight to the lighthouse with his camera to take pictures before the Coast Guard could climb up to take the flag down. He had been touched by his daughter&#x2019;s Irish pride, and by her way of making a statement&#x2013;regardless of risk. <br><br>Almost like his sculptures; he called them &#x201c;sandcastles,&#x201d; which called to mind gentle beaches, families building fragile towers in the sand at the water&#x2019;s edge. But John&#x2019;s installations were sharp, kinetic, made of rock and fallen trees, dangerous to build. <br><br>Now, on this craggy headland in West Cork, the spiky top of his latest&#x2013;the bare, unadorned branches of a tree that had fallen somewhere, hauled here by John&#x2013;was visible over the next rise, at the edge of a cliff, ninety-foot granite walls that dropped straight into the churning sea.<br><br>Honor stood at the bedroom window of the farmhouse he&#x2019;d rented, looking out. John came out of the shower to stand behind her, putting his arms around her and leaning into her. Their clothes lay in a heap beside the bed. Her sketchpad, abandoned yet again, sat on the desk. She had made a few drawings, but her heart wasn&#x2019;t in it. <br><br>&#x201c;What were you drawing before?&#x201d; he asked, his lips against her ear. He sounded tentative, as if he wasn&#x2019;t sure how she&#x2019;d respond.<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the artist in the family.&#x201d;<br><br>Honor pressed against his body, wishing she could turn off her thoughts and give in again to the desire that overtook her every time she saw her husband. She wished he hadn&#x2019;t asked about her drawing.<br>She gazed down at the small pile of moonstones&#x2013;luminous, worn smooth by the waves at the foot of the cliff, a gift from John the minute she&#x2019;d stepped off the plane&#x2013;on the desk beside her sketchpad. She knew he&#x2019;d meant them as a peace offering, but her heart was reluctant to accept it. She felt turned inside out, frayed from the stress of trying to keep up with him. He turned her toward him, pulled her body against his, and kissed her. <br>&#x201c;The girls,&#x201d; Honor said.<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re sleeping,&#x201d; he whispered, gesturing toward their daughters&#x2019; room as he tried to pull her back to bed. <br><br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Honor said, &#x201c;They&#x2019;re jet-lagged and exhausted from the excitement of being here, seeing you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But what about you?&#x201d; he asked, stroking her hair and kissing the side of her neck. He sounded so hopeful, as if he thought maybe this trip could stop what they both felt happening between them, stop what they had always had from slipping away forever. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not tired?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, me too,&#x201d; she said, kissing him. She was beyond tired; of wanting him to come home, of worrying that he&#x2019;d get hurt or killed working on his installations alone, of wishing he&#x2019;d understand how worn out she was by the demands of his art. At the same time, she was tired of being blocked. It was as if his intense inspiration had started killing the fire of her own. Even her drawings, such as they were, were of his soaring sculpture just over the next rise. She peered out the window, but the structure was now obscured by today&#x2019;s wild storm. <br><br>He had taken them all to the cliff edge yesterday, when they&#x2019;d first arrived. He&#x2019;d shown them the ruins of an old castle, a lookout tower built a thousand years ago. Sheep grazed on the hillsides, impossibly steep, slanting down to the sea. The sheep roamed free, their curly white wool splashed with red or blue paint, identifying them for their owners. They grazed right at the base of John&#x2019;s sculpture.<br><br>It affected Honor deeply&#x2013;to see her husband&#x2019;s work here in Ireland. They had dreamed of coming for so long&#x2013;ever since that day twenty five years ago when she, John, Bernie, and Tom had found the box in the stone wall. Honor knew that John had always felt a primal pull to be here, to try to connect with the timeless spirits of his family, as Bernie and Tom had done years earlier. In this green and ancient land, his own family history meshed powerfully with his artistic instincts, an epiphany in earth and stone.<br><br>His sculpture awed her, as his work often did&#x2013;she found it inspiring, disturbing, stunning, rather than beautiful. She knew the physical effort it took him to drag the tree trunks and branches here to the cliff&#x2019;s edge, to raise them up and balance them against the wind, to haul rocks into the pile&#x2013;cutting his hands and forearms, bruising his knuckles. John had hands like a prize-fighter&#x2019;s: scarred and swollen. Only, it had so often seemed to Honor, that the person he was most fighting was himself.<br><br>The sculpture rose up from the land like a castle; echoing the ruins just across the gap. It seemed to grow from the ground, as if it had been there forever, a witness to his family who had worked this land, farmed these fields, starved during the famine. He was descended from famine orphans, and as he and Honor and their daughters walked the property, she had to hold back tears to think of what their ancestors had gone through.<br><br>And what John experienced now. He was an artist, through and through. He channeled powers from far beyond his own experience&#x2013;became one with the ghosts, and the bones, and the spirits that had suffered and died. That&#x2019;s why he&#x2019;d come to Ireland alone&#x2013;to haunt the Cobh docks from which his family had emigrated, to drink in the pubs, and to build this monument to his Irish dead.<br><br>His sister Bernie&#x2013;Sister Bernadette Ignatius&#x2013;was probably the only person who really understood him. Honor loved him, but she didn&#x2019;t get what drove him, and she was also a little scared of him. Not that he&#x2019;d ever hurt her or the girls, but that he&#x2019;d die in pursuit of his art. It wore her down, it did.<br><br>She&#x2019;d felt exhausted yesterday, standing at the base of his huge, ambitious, soaring, reckless installation. How had the wind and the weight of his materials not carried him over the edge of the cliff? How had the storm-scoured branches, the bark stripped right off them,...</p><h2>Buffalo: Natural History &amp; Conservation</h2><p><p>The millions of buffalo that once roamed across the North American continent were vitally important to the Native Americans, who relied on them for everything from food to spiritual beliefs.

Reissue.</p><p><b>Rex Stout</b> (1886&#x2013;1975) wrote dozens of short stories, novellas, and full-length mystery novels, most featuring his two indelible characters, the peerless detective Nero Wolfe and his handy sidekick, Archie Goodwin.Someone drops off an infant on the doorstep of a wealthy and attractive widow. She hires Nero Wolfe, the famed P.I., to ferret out the baby's mother. A couple of murders result from the investigation, placing the onus on Wolfe and his street-smart legman, Archie Goodwin, to nab the killer. When reading this and other Wolfe whodunits, one gets the distinct impression that Archie, for all his complaining, not only loves working for the obese orchid-growing P.I., but gets a huge charge from writing about their cases. One gets none of that from listening to Michael Prichard's oral renderings of Stout's oeuvre for Audio Editions. He is as flat as a pancake, not even bothering to look up the pronunciation of some of Wolfe's less familiar expressions. To borrow one of Wolfe's MORE familiar terms--Pfui!

Written by the author of Asterix, Rene Goscinny, and with illustrations by New Yorker illustrator, Jean-Jacques Sempe, the five Nicholas books tell of the endearing exploits of the young French school boy and his chums.&#34;</p><p>Starred review from PUBLISHERS WEEKLY, June 27, 2005: <p>Phaidon takes a sure step into the children's book arena with this entirely engaging volume, a winning combination of writing, translating and illustrating that gives youngsters a flavor of France (where it has been a bestseller since its 1959 publication). Goscinny's (Asterix) collection of 19 linked tales stars high-spirited narrator Nicholas, a French schoolboy who, along with his classmates, has a knack for landing in trouble. Seemingly quotidian situations in Nicholas's life yield riotous repercussions, as the incessant squabbling among the youngsters tends to result in a delightful domino effect, until events culminate in a comedic climax. A disastrous class photo session drives the photographer away before he snaps the shot, a pick-up soccer game sends the kids bickering about their positions until they're finally set (then realize they have no ball), and a new boy in class who doesn't speak English spouts the off-color language he has picked up from his peers. The hero's recurring references to several students function as humorous comic bits (such as Alec, "my friend who is fat and he likes eating" or Cuthbert, who "is top of the class and we're not crazy about him, but we can't hit him because he wears glasses"). New Yorker and Paris Match artist Semp�'s droll line drawings reinforce the text's exuberance, and Bell's translation gives the narrative a wry British spin. And there's additional good news: the publisher has scheduled more Nicholas adventures for future release. Ages 9-12.</p>Rene Goscinny (1926-77), born in Paris, lived most of his early years in Buenos Aires and New York. He returned to France in the 1950s where he met Jean-Jacques Sempe and together they created the character of Nicholas, the famous schoolboy. He later worked with Albert Uderzo on making the adventures of Asterix the Gaul. A prolific and internationally successful children&#39;s author, he is also the creator of Lucky Luke and Dingodossiers, among others. He received Cesars repeatedly for his numerous animated cartoons. Jean-Jacques Sempe (b.1932), expelled from school for bad behaviour, enjoyed a vast range of jobs including winebroker and supervisor at children&#39;s holiday camps. His world-renowned illustrations and cartoons are featured on the covers of the New Yorker magazine and amuse the readers of Paris Match and the Figaro Litteraire on a weekly basis.

In <i>Underbug</i>, the award-winning journalist Lisa Margonelli introduces us to the enigmatic creatures that collectively outweigh human beings ten to one and consume $40 billion worth of valuable stuff annually&#x2015;and yet, in Margonelli&#x2019;s telling, seem weirdly familiar. Over the course of a decade-long obsession with the little bugs, Margonelli pokes around termite mounds and high-tech research facilities, closely watching biologists, roboticists, and geneticists. Her globe-trotting journey veers into uncharted territory, from evolutionary theory to Edwardian science literature to the military industrial complex. What begins as a natural history of the termite becomes a personal exploration of the unnatural future we&#x2019;re building, with darker observations on power, technology, historical trauma, and the limits of human cognition.</p><p>Whether in Namibia or Cambridge, Arizona or Australia, Margonelli turns up astounding facts and raises provocative questions. Is a termite an individual or a unit of a superorganism? Can we harness the termite&#x2019;s properties to change the world? If we build termite-like swarming robots, will they inevitably destroy us? Is it possible to think without having a mind? <i>Underbug</i> burrows into these questions and many others&#x2015;unearthing disquieting answers about the world&#x2019;s most underrated insect and what it means to be human.</p></p><p><b>Lisa Margonelli</b> is the author of the national bestseller <i>Oil on the</i><i> Brain: Petroleum&#x2019;s Long, Strange Trip to Your Tank </i>and writes the Small Science column for <i>Z�calo Public Square</i>, where she is a senior editor.

They also comprise a kind of entomological three-ring circus, and this round-up of research on the eusocial insects is a ticket to the show . . . This is a wild ride through a hidden microcosmos stretching from Australia to Namibia.&#x201d; &#x2015;<b>Barbara Kiser, <i>Nature</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Margonelli uses her &#x2018;obsessive&#x2019; termite tale to open wider discussions about everything from the evolution of superorganisms to the morality of military drones.

Margonelli brings all of this to light by making complex, cutting-edge science understandable to the general reader, while also conveying the excitement, frustration, and plain drudgery inherent in the scientific endeavor. ...Margonelli has written a book as entertaining as it is informative." <i>&#x2015;<b>Publishers Weekly</b></i></p><p>"This book is about termites the way the Bible is about men with beards. Yes, it takes you into the mounds and inside the bugs, but also deep into the strange labs and pulsing, eclectic minds of the roboticists, geneticists, physicists, and ecologists who try to figure them out. Perhaps best of all, it takes you deep into the brain of Lisa Margonelli, one of the finest writers and most original thinkers we have.

It was Atlantis, Arcadia, Avalon, El Dorado, the Garden of Eden, the Land of Milk and Honey, the Pleasure Dome of Kublai Khan. It was always a magnet for dreamers. In this fascinating book Dora Beale Polk examines the dreams and myths that influenced the discovery and exploration of California.&nbsp;Throughout, Polk treats the long-held concept of California as an island, going back to medieval lore that filled an unknown ocean with rich, mysterious ideal islands. Columbus carried the lore to the New World, expecting to find islands teeming with gold, pearls, fabulous creatures, and Amazon women. Cort�s was led by the &#x201c;romance of the islands.&#x201d; Balboa, Cabrillo, Drake, Ascensi�n, Kino, and many others entered into the making of the island myth. The discoveries and explorations of all the major figures are traced and their reports analyzed as they relate to California&#x2019;s geography and to the dreams overlaying it.</p><p>Dora Beale Polk is a professor of English at California State University at Long Beach. She has published popular suspense novels and poetry as well as scholarly works.&#x201c;Polk weaves threads from history, literature, mythology, cartography, and geography into a tapestry attesting the durability of the myth.&#x201d;&#x2014;A. J. R. Russell-Wood, <i>Choice</i> (A. J. R. Russell-Wood <i>Choice</i>)</p><h2>Desert</h2><p>The Swedish Academy, in awarding J.M.G. Le Clezio the 2008 Nobel Prize in Literature, praised Desert as Le Clezio's definitive breakthrough as a novelist. Published in France in 1980, Desert received the Grand Prix Paul Morand from the Academie Francaise, was translated into twenty-three languages, and quickly proved to be a best-selling novel in many countries around the world.<br><br>Available for the first time in English translation, Desert is a novel composed of two alternating narratives, set in counterpoint. The first takes place in the desert between 1909 and 1912 and evokes the migration of a young adolescent boy, Nour, and his people, the Blue Men, notorious warriors of the desert. Driven from their lands by French colonial soldiers, Nour's tribe has come to the valley of the Saguiet El Hamra to seek the aid of the great spiritual leader known as Water of the Eyes. The religious chief sends them out from the holy city of Smara into the desert to travel still further. Spurred on by thirst, hunger, and suffering, Nour's tribe and others flee northward in the hopes of finding a land that can harbor them at last.<br><br>The second narrative relates the contemporary story of Lalla, a descendant of the Blue Men. Though she is an orphan living in a shantytown known as the Project near a coastal city in Morocco, the blood of her proud, obstinate tribe runs in her veins. All too soon, Lalla must flee to escape a forced marriage with an older, wealthy man. She travels to France, undergoing many trials there, from working in a brothel to success as a highly paid fashion model, but she never betrays the blood of her ancestors.</p><p>Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clezio -- a novelist, essayist, and short story writer -- has published more than forty works of fiction and non-fiction. In 2008, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature and described by the Swedish Academy as an &#34;author of new departures, poetic adventure, and sensual ecstasy, explorer of a humanity beyond and below the reigning civilization.&#34;Desert is a rich, sprawling, searching, poetic, provocative, broadly historic and demanding novel, which in all those ways displays the essence of Le Clezio. As a reflection on colonization and its legacy, it is painfully relevant after 30 years. --Elizabeth Hawes, The New York Times (8/30/2009)<br><br>One of the few works by 2008 Nobel laureate Le Clezio to be translated into English, this mythic novel tells two parallel stories of descendants of a holy man called Al Azraq. The novel begins with Nour, a Berber boy who bears witness to the failed rebellion led by Sheik Ma el Ainine against the French in the years leading up to WWI. In the cadences of an incantation, Le Clezio renders the dire suffering of the displaced desert peoples who turn to Ma el Ainine for guidance. The parallel story, set in the near-contemporary, portrays Lalla, a young woman who lives on the Moroccan coast and spends her days exploring the seashore and listening to the stories of her aunt and the fisherman Old Naman. After escaping an arranged marriage, Lalla lands in Marseille and finds not the gleaming white city of Naman's stories but a cruel place cut off from nature. Le Clezio's vision is cinematic, his language lyrical and the lives he portrays are vivid and convincing. --Publisher's Weekly<br><br>This work contains magnificent images of a lost culture in the North African desert, contrasted with a depiction of Europe seen through the eyes of unwanted immigrants. The main character, the Algerian guest worker Lalla, is a utopian antithesis to the ugliness and brutality of European society. --from the Nobel citation by the Swedish Academy<br><br>When French writer Le Clezio was presented with the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2008, the response of many Americans was, Who? That's because so few of his stunning works have been translated into English, including this 1980 fever dream of a novel about earth and spirit, war and exile. In poetic language at once piercingly realistic and rhapsodically supernatural, Le Clezio tells the dramatic stories of two mystical, resilient children of the North African desert, members of a nomadic tribe of warriors. Nour endures a horrific forced march across the desert just prior to World War I, as French soldiers invade and a holy sheik struggles to keep the planet s last free people free. Decades later, Lalla, a shantytown seer channeling the hidden life force of the forbidding desert, is forced to flee Morocco for Marseilles, where she witnesses the misery of other despised immigrants. In scenes of shimmering intensity, Le Clezio contrasts nature s stark and majestic clarity, from scouring sand to the incinerating sun and the vast gleaming net of stars, with the chaos, toxicity, and injustice of human life. A long time coming for English-language readers, Le Clezio s incandescent masterpiece couldn't be more relevant. --Donna Seaman, Booklist (starred review)<br><br>Desert is a rich, sprawling, searching, poetic, provocative, broadly historic and demanding novel, which in all those ways displays the essence of Le Cl�zio. As a reflection on colonization and its legacy, it is painfully relevant after 30 years. --Elizabeth Hawes, The New York Times (8/30/2009)</p><h2>Scholastic Discover More: My Body</h2><p><br>Scholastic Discover More is a revolutionary new nonfiction line pairing stunning print books with corresponding interactive digital books that extend the learning online.<br>MY BODY unlocks a free 16-page digital companion book offering even more information, photos, and videos!<br><br>MY BODY answers children&#x2019;s questions about their own bodies in an incredibly simple and appropriate way.

A penniless and as yet unpublished writer, Henry Miller arrived in Paris in 1930. Leaving behind a disintegrating marriage and an unhappy career in America, he threw himself into the low-life of bohemian Paris with unwavering gusto. A fictional account of Miller&#39;s adventures amongst the prostitutes and pimps, the penniless painters and writers of Montparnasse, Tropic of Cancer is an extravagant and rhapsodic hymn to a world of unrivalled eroticism and freedom. Tropic of Cancer&#39;s 1934 publication in France was hailed by Samuel Beckett as &#39;a momentous event in the history of modern writing&#39;. The novel was subsequently banned in the UK and the USA and not released for publication for a further thirty years.</p><p>No punches are pulled in Henry Miller's most famous work. Still pretty rough going for even our jaded sensibilities, but <i>Tropic of Cancer</i> is an unforgettable novel of self-confession. Maybe the most honest book ever written, this autobiographical fiction about Miller's life as an expatriate American in Paris was deemed obscene and banned from publication in this country for years. When you read this, you see immediately how much modern writers owe Miller.Henry Miller (1891-1980) was one of the most influential and controversial novelists of the twentieth century.</p><h2>Never too late: My musical life story</h2><p>If I could learn to play the cello well, as I thought I could, I could show by my own example that we all have greater powers than we think; that whatever we want to learn or learn to do, we probably can learn; that our lives and our possibilities are not determined and fixed by what happened to us when we were little, or by what experts say we can or cannot do.� Best known for his brilliant insight into the way children learn, John Holt was also an intrepid explorer of adult learning. At the age of forty, with no particular musical background, he took up the cello.

The manga included in the back of the book is flashy and exquisitely drawn but painfully short; this volume is primary a work of prose. An excerpt from an <i>xxxHOLiC</i> light novel (a short genre novel aimed at young adult readers) opens the book; unfortunately, the interesting part of CLAMP's manga is the artwork, and in prose form the story is lacking. The highlight of the book is Otaro Maijo's Drill Hole in My Brain, a piece of pop culture&#x2013;filled, avant-garde pornography written in the style of William S. Burroughs or Mark Leyner. A boy with a screwdriver stuck in his brain narrates a brilliant psychedelic stream-of-consciousness sexual fantasy that takes place inside his head. F-Sensei's Pocket is a surprising and delightful story of what happens when the two most hated girls in class come into the possession of several magical items from <i>Doraemon</i>. The many amusing self-referential nods to the publisher Kodansha and copyright infringement add to the fresh, contemporary feel of the piece. The Garden of Sinners excerpt is hindered by a hard-to-follow shifting perspective and a particularly nonsensical philosophy of flying. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She also documents the response of opponents to Carson's message, notably the powerful chemical industry, including efforts to undermine, delay, or stop publication altogether. </p><p>Murphy then investigates the media's role, showing that it went well beyond providing a forum for debate. In addition, she analyzes the perceptions and expectations of the public at large regarding the book, the debate, and the media. By probing all of these perspectives, Murphy sheds new light on the dynamic between newsmaking books, the media, and the public. In the process, she addresses a host of broader questions about the place of books in American culture, past, present, and future.</p></p><p>A volume in the series Studies in Print Culture and the History of the Book."A highly readable and often illuminating history of the writing and aftermath of Rachel Carson&#x2019;s masterpiece affirms the unique place of the book as an agent of change, and raises timely questions about science, the media, and the right to know."&#x2014;"Orion Journal" <p>"Discusses the entire process of envisioning, researching, writing, publishing, marketing, distributing, disseminating, and defending Rachel Carson&#x2019;s 'Silent Spring'. . . .

Three years later he was playing a $40 game of online Texas Hold 'Em and won a coveted seat at the 2003 World Series of Poker. Borrowing money to get to Las Vegas, he entered his first real-time tournament and spent the next four days battling for a top spot at the final table.</p><p>Filled with everything from his early gambling ventures to a play-by-play of his major hands at the World Series of Poker, <em>Moneymaker</em> is a gripping, fast-paced story for anyone who has ever dreamed of winning it big.</p></p><p><p>Chris Moneymaker is the winner of the 2003 World Series of Poker. </p>*Starred Review* With all the poker how-to books available now, why another one? Well, this one is more about the story than about the cards. Moneymaker (yes, that's his name, and he's teased about it every day) was just a guy who played cards. When he earned a seat to play in the World Series of Poker by putting up only $40 through an online casino, he figured he'd be relegated to the "coulda" camp by the middle of day one. Instead, he went on to win that illustrious series, picking up a cool $2.5 million. Overcoming first-day jitters, sitting with his heroes, learning from the pros--Moneymaker describes it all with glee and, even now, with a sense of unbelief, the feeling that he can't believe it really happened. That's the beauty of this story: Moneymaker is an Everyman for the gambling ages--if he could do it, why not me? It's no wonder Internet gaming is at an all-time high, with true-life rags-to-riches stories like this one to inspire us. With the help of coauthor Paisner, Moneymaker details the key hands of the tourney and his feelings as each day's play concludes and the next one begins. The account ends with a brief bio of the author's life since his victory. Some standard back matter, including a what-beats-what list and a glossary, round out this thoroughly entertaining book. A must for any gambling collection. <i>Mary Frances Wilkens</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Hence, care has been taken to recall briefly the truths of faith on which the spiritual life rests. This treatise then is first of all doctrinal in character and aims at bringing out the fact that Christian perfection is the logical outcome of dogma, especially of the central dogma of the Incarnation. The work however is also practical, for a vivid realization of the truths of faith is the strongest incentive to earnest and steady efforts towards the correction of faults and the practice of virtues. Consequently in the first part of this treatise the practical conclusions that naturally flow from revealed truths and the general means of perfection are developed.

Grant and suggests that peace between Whites and Cheyenne could be established if the Cheyenne were given white women as wives, and that the tribe would agree to raise the children from such unions. Grant secretly recruits 1,000 women from jails, penitentiaries, debtors' prisons, and mental institutions offering full pardons or unconditional release. </p><p> May, who jumps at the chance, embarks upon the adventure of her lifetime, along with a colourful assembly of pioneer women. She keeps the fictional journal we read, marries Little Wolf, lives in a crowded tipi with his two other wives and their children and lives the life of a Cheyenne squaw. </p><p> 'Jim Fergus so skillfully envelops us in the heart and mind of his main character, May Dodd, that we weep when she mourns, we shake our fist at anyone who tries to sway her course, and our hearts pound when she is in danger'--"Colorado Springs Gazett"e </p><p></p></p><p>WINNER OF THE MOUNTAINS AND PLAINS BOOKSELLERS AWARD<p> "Jim Fergus's <i>One Thousand White Women</i> is a splendid, fresh, and engaging novel.

Yet the unknown is a far better fate than the life she left behind: committed to an insane asylum by her blueblood family for the crime of loving a man beneath her station, May finds that her only hope of freedom is to participate in a secret government program whereby women from the "civilized" world become the brides of Cheyenne warriors. What follows is the story of May's breathtaking adventures: her brief, passionate romance with the gallant young army captain John Bourke; her marriage to the great chief Little Wolf; and her conflict of being caught between two worlds, loving two men, living two lives. </p><p>So vividly has Jim Fergus depicted the American West that May Dodd's journals are like a capsule in time.</p></p><h2>Nehru: The Invention Of India</h2><p>The author of India: From Midnight to the Millennium provides a close-up portrait of Jawaharlal Nehru, India&#39;s first prime minister, the influential politician who led his newly independent nation from colonialism into the modern world, and his lasting legacy in terms of India&#39;s history and world role. 12,500 first printing.</p><p>The Indian consensus that Jawaharlal Nehru (1889-1964) constructed as the nation's first prime minister, Tharoor writes with unsparing objectivity, "has frayed: democracy endures, secularism is besieged, nonalignment is all but forgotten, and socialism barely clings on." Nehru seems "curiously dated, a relic of another era." His goal of creating "a just state by just means" has been undermined by the centrifugal forces of Indian religious and cultural divisiveness. Tharoor's short and highly readable life never lacks for pithy phrases and strong opinions. A senior U.N. official, Tharoor (India: From Midnight to the Millennium) writes with shrewd wit and cautious ambivalence about Nehru, whom he admires as the Thomas Jefferson of India-a foe of colonialism, a statesman of grace and style and a master of uplifting words-but whose leadership failed in forcefulness and whose political heirs were without his charm. Nehru's privileged Kashmiri background and Harrow-Cambridge education left him replete with paradoxes-a reserved aristocrat yet a near Marxist, a demigod (to the masses) and a democrat (to himself), a political prisoner of the British for nine years who was even more a prisoner to his own "vainglory," an idealist with "a moralism that stood somewhere to the left of morality." Tharoor's distant villain is the curmudgeonly Winston Churchill, whose staunch "racist imperialism," particularly toward India, made his "subsequent beatification as an apostle of freedom... all the more preposterous." This engaging short biography is a scrutiny of a major 20th-century leader from his "Little Lord Fauntleroy" beginnings to his transformation into a historic figure wearing a halo in his own lifetime. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.Tharoor presents an uncomplicated overview of Nehru's life that is, with rare exceptions, an admiring one. True, the author admits, Nehru hung on to power too long, dying in harness in 1964, but the ledger definitely is positive in Tharoor's accounting. Tharoor confines his opinions to asides, however, and directly narrates Nehru's personal chronology: his education in England; his arranged marriage and attachment to daughter Indira; and, naturally, his political relationships during the protests of the 1920s and 1930s and the negotiations of 1945-47 that eventuated in such tragedy. Readers new to Nehru will receive an efficient introduction by Tharoor. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

After serving a short time in the 7th U.S. Cavalry, Burroughs was a shopkeeper, gold miner, cowboy, and policeman before becoming a full-time writer. His first novel, <b>Tarzan of the Apes</b>, was published in 1914, and along with its 22 sequels has sold over 30 million copies in 58 languages. Author of numerous other jungle and science fiction novels and novellas, including <b>The Land That Time Forgot</b>, Burroughs had a writing career that spanned almost 30 years, with his last novel, <b>The Land of Terror</b>, being published in 1941. He died in 1950 at his ranch near Tarzana, the California town named for his legendary hero.</p>Here are two more volumes in the publisher's ongoing series of sf classics. Burroughs's Pirates was initially serialized in Argosy Weekly in 1932 and released in book form soon after. It features astronaut Carson Napier, who becomes stranded on Venus and finds himself swept into numerous adventures. The Poison Belt portrays Conan Doyle's other great creation, Professor Challenger. In this 1913 outing, the professor grapples with the problem of Earth's passing through a poisonous cloud, putting humankind's existence in jeopardy. Both books feature vintage illustrations.

In his dedicated concern with form and structure, he stands apart from the mainstream of Impressionist painting, extending its range into a new art of visual analysis.<br>C�zanne, sensitive and shy, shunned the Parisian caf� society of his fellow artists, preferring to live and work alone in his native Provence which provided the inspiration for so many of his paintings. Less immediately appealing to a wider audience than, for example, Monet and Degas, C�zanne is nonetheless of immense importance through the influence he exerted on so many of the artists who followed him, such as Picasso and Matisse.<br>Blessed with financial independence through the efforts of his banker father, he fortunately enjoyed a freedom to pursue his art without the demands of making a living felt by so many of his fellow artists.</p><p></p><h2>Gospel of Gabriel</h2><p>The pen of Archangel Gabriel records this poetic Gospel of Jesus&#39; human struggles--of flesh, faith, and finally, death.

After a first chapter on the existential background and the key issues of his thought, chapters 2, 3, and 4 concentrate on and include a short text, "Philosophy and the idea of the Infinite," which contains the program of Levinas's entire oeuvre. Chapter 5 is a companion to the reading of Levinas's first opus magnum,<i> Totality and the Infinite</i>. It analyzes the structure of this book and shows how its questions and answers adhere together. "Through phenomenology toward a saying beyond phenomena and essence" could be the summary of Levinas's attempt to think, with and against Martin Heidegger, the otherness of the Other. This is brought out even more clearly in his second opus magnum, <i>Otherwise Than Being or Beyond Essence</i>, whose significance is shown in chapter 6.

In June 1816, the flagship of a French expedition to repossess a colony in Senegal from the British set sail. She never arrived at her destination; her incompetent captain Hugo de Chaumareys, ignoring telltale signs of shallow waters, plowed the ship into a famously treacherous sandbar. A privileged few claimed the lifeboats while 146 men and one woman were herded aboard a makeshift raft and set adrift. Without a compass or many provisions, hit by a vicious storm the first night, and exposed to sweltering heat during the following days, the group set upon each other: mayhem, mutiny, and murder ensued. When rescue arrived thirteen days later only fifteen were alive. Meanwhile, those in the boats who made it to shore undertook a dangerous two-hundred-mile slog through the desert. Among the handful of survivors from the raft were two men whose written account of the fiasco became a bestseller that rocked France&#x2019;s political foundations and provided graphic fodder for G�ricault&#x2019;s world-famous painting.</p><p>In June 1816 French frigate <i>Medusa</i> ran aground on a sandbar off the African coast. What followed&#x2014;gross incompetence, murder and cannibalism&#x2014;shocked European society and pushed the fragile, recently restored French monarchy to the brink. From the swirl of characters boiling around the story&#x2014;admirals, ministers and kings&#x2014;Miles (<i>David Jones: The Maker Unmade</i>) anchors his tale on <i>Medusa</i> survivor Alexandre Correard and painter Th�odore G�ricault. After surviving the wreck and subsequently drifting on a raft on which 133 of 147 died, Correard, an engineer fleeing the growing chaos in post-Napoleonic France, wrote a bestselling account of the tragedy and agitated for the monarchy's end. Revealed in the ensuing controversy was France's ongoing participation in the illegal trade of African slaves. With such great elements in place (flesh eating, palace intrigue and illicit love) this yarn has much promise. Unfortunately, while the story roars along with its own inherent momentum, Miles's prose is sometimes awkward ("Their union was obviously intense and, as with all true love, supremely precious. Catastrophically, it was to prove short-lived"). Nevertheless, the story of the wreck of the <i>Medusa</i> and the churning cultural machinations around it does make for a compelling read. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.An iconic painting of the Romantic era, Le radeau de la M�duse, by Th�odore G�ricault (1791&#x2013;1824), immortalized a French maritime disaster in 1816. Unpacking the visual power of the image, author Miles proves to be both an astute art historian and a dramatic chronicler of the catastrophe. Several people survived to record accounts; these ignited a political scandal in France as the royalist captain's incompetence and callousness stoked criticism of the restored Bourbon monarchy. Sensing an opportunity, G�ricault faced the&nbsp;challenge&nbsp;of determining what moment of the survival drama to depict, for&nbsp;survivors' accounts&nbsp;contained discrepancies. He decided to omit riot, murder, and cannibalism and to include elements condemning Louis XVIII's regime, such as the accusing, outstretched arm of survivor Alexandre Corr�ard. Since Corr�ard's story&nbsp;changed in successive editions, Miles&nbsp;is wary&nbsp;about Corr�ard's factual fidelity, lending historical depth to&nbsp;the narrative without detracting from&nbsp;Miles' insights into the&nbsp;suffering and betrayal provoked by G�ricault's morbid masterpiece. Relating its popular reception, along with the subsequent lives of artist and subject, Miles crafts a captivating gem about art's relation to history.

Sugar clings to the memory of her mother's stories and lives for her weekly visits to the prison when her grandmother is feeling up to the bus ride. On their shared birthday, Mama gives Sugar a special gift and a special way to feel close to her. Although this may be an issue that needs to be addressed, and although there is an audience for whom this story may be appropriate, the text and artwork present some problems. While the book does not go so far as to glorify imprisonment, it certainly does not present a realistic view of an extremely difficult way of life and the challenges it presents in maintaining a relationship with a child. In an attempt to emphasize the enduring bond between mother and daughter, the writing is often clich�d and the illustrations seem to exhibit an unnatural, idealistic brightness. The word "prison" is never mentioned, and the character of Big Roger is never clearly identified, possibly leaving young readers with more questions than answers about a very sensitive issue.<i> - Holly T.

It explains how in each decade, political leaders found themselves confounded by the British people, who always turned out to be harder to herd than predicted. Historically Britain has been a country on the edge first of invasion, then of bankruptcy, then on the vulnerable front line of the Cold War, and later in the forefront of the great opening up of capital and migration. This history follows all the political and economic stories of the modern era as well as with such social trends as comedy, cars, the war against homosexuals, oil-men and punks, Margaret Thatcher&#x2019;s wonderful good luck, political lies, and the true heroes of British theater.</p></p><p>Andrew Marr is a journalist and former political editor for the BBC.

Images&#x2014;hers, not mine&#x2014;tumbled through my mind: fire and blood, the smell of smoke, the twisted metal of a car. The pictures wrapped around me, suffocating me, until some rational part of my brain reminded me that this wasn&#x2019;t <i>my</i> dream.</p><p>I woke up, strands of long, dark hair sticking to my forehead.</p><p>Lissa lay in her bed, thrashing and screaming. I bolted out of mine, quickly crossing the few feet that separated us.</p><p>&#x201c;Liss,&#x201d; I said, shaking her. &#x201c;Liss, wake up.&#x201d;</p><p>Her screams dropped off, replaced by soft whimpers. &#x201c;Andre,&#x201d; she moaned. &#x201c;Oh God.&#x201d;</p><p>I helped her sit up. &#x201c;Liss, you aren&#x2019;t there anymore. Wake up.&#x201d;</p><p>After a few moments, her eyes fluttered open, and in the dim lighting, I could see a flicker of consciousness start to take over. Her frantic breathing slowed, and she leaned into me, resting her head against my shoulder. I put an arm around her and ran a hand over her hair.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; I told her gently. &#x201c;Everything&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I had that dream.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. I know.&#x201d;</p><p>We sat like that for several minutes, not saying anything else. When I felt her emotions calm down, I leaned over to the nightstand between our beds and turned on the lamp. It glowed dimly, but neither of us really needed much to see by. Attracted by the light, our housemate&#x2019;s cat Oscar leapt up into the open window.</p><p>He gave me a wide berth&#x2014;animals don&#x2019;t like dhampirs, for whatever reason&#x2014;but jumped up on the bed and rubbed his head against Lissa, purring softly. Animals didn&#x2019;t have a problem with Moroi, and they all loved Lissa in particular. Smiling, she scratched his chin, and I felt her calm further.</p><p>&#x201c;When did we last do a feeding?&#x201d; I asked, studying her face. Her fair skin was paler than usual. Dark circles hung under her eyes, and there was an air of frailty about her. School had been hectic this week, and I couldn&#x2019;t remember the last time I&#x2019;d given her blood. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been like . . . over two days, hasn&#x2019;t it? Three? Why didn&#x2019;t you say anything?&#x201d;</p><p>She shrugged and wouldn&#x2019;t meet my eyes. &#x201c;You were busy. I didn&#x2019;t want to&#x2014;;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Screw that,&#x201d; I said, shifting into a better position. No wonder she seemed so weak. Oscar, not wanting me any closer, leapt down and returned to the window, where he could watch at a safe distance. &#x201c;Come on. Let&#x2019;s do this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rose&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Come on. It&#x2019;ll make you feel better.&#x201d;</p><p>I tilted my head and tossed my hair back, baring my neck. I saw her hesitate, but the sight of my neck and what it offered proved too powerful. A hungry expression crossed her face, and her lips parted slightly, exposing the fangs she normally kept hidden while living among humans. Those fangs contrasted oddly with the rest of her features. With her pretty face and pale blond hair, she looked more like an angel than a vampire.</p><p>As her teeth neared my bare skin, I felt my heart race with a mix of fear and anticipation. I always hated feeling the latter, but it was nothing I could help, a weakness I couldn&#x2019;t shake.</p><p>Her fangs bit into me, hard, and I cried out at the brief flare of pain. Then it faded, replaced by a wonderful, golden joy that spread through my body. It was better than any of the times I&#x2019;d been drunk or high. Better than sex&#x2014;or so I imagined, since I&#x2019;d never done it. It was a blanket of pure, refined pleasure, wrapping me up and promising everything would be right in the world. On and on it went. The chemicals in her saliva triggered an endorphin rush, and I lost track of the world, lost track of who I was.</p><p>Then, regretfully, it was over. It had taken less than a minute.</p><p>She pulled back, wiping her hand across her lips as she studied me. &#x201c;You okay?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I . . . yeah.&#x201d; I lay back on the bed, dizzy from the blood loss. &#x201c;I just need to sleep it off. I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d;</p><p>Her pale, jade-green eyes watched me with concern. She stood up. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to get you something to eat.&#x201d;</p><p>My protests came awkwardly to my lips, and she left before I could get out a sentence. The buzz from her bite had lessened as soon as she broke the connection, but some of it still lingered in my veins, and I felt a goofy smile cross my lips. Turning my head, I glanced up at Oscar, still sitting in the window.</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re missing,&#x201d; I told him.</p><p>His attention was on something outside. Hunkering down into a crouch, he puffed out his jet-black fur. His tail started twitching.</p><p>My smile faded, and I forced myself to sit up. The world spun, and I waited for it to right itself before trying to stand. When I managed it, the dizziness set in again and this time refused to leave. Still, I felt okay enough to stumble to the window and peer out with Oscar. He eyed me warily, scooted over a little, and then returned to whatever had held his attention.</p><p>A warm breeze&#x2014;unseasonably warm for a Portland fall&#x2014;played with my hair as I leaned out. The street was dark and relatively quiet. It was three in the morning, just about the only time a college campus settled down, at least somewhat. The house in which we&#x2019;d rented a room for the past eight months sat on a residential street with old, mismatched houses. Across the road, a streetlight flickered, nearly ready to burn out. It still cast enough light for me to make out the shapes of cars and buildings. In our own yard, I could see the silhouettes of trees and bushes.</p><p>And a man watching me.</p><p>I jerked back in surprise. A figure stood by a tree in the yard, about thirty feet away, where he could easily see through the window. He was close enough that I probably could have thrown something and hit him. He was certainly close enough that he could have seen what Lissa and I had just done.</p><p>The shadows covered him so well that even with my heightened sight, I couldn&#x2019;t make out any of his features, save for his height. He was tall. Really tall. He stood there for just a moment, barely discernible, and then stepped back, disappearing into the shadows cast by the trees on the far side of the yard. I was pretty sure I saw someone else move nearby and join him before the blackness swallowed them both.</p><p>Whoever these figures were, Oscar didn&#x2019;t like them. Not counting me, he usually got along with most people, growing upset only when someone posed an immediate danger. The guy outside hadn&#x2019;t done anything threatening to Oscar, but the cat had sensed something, something that put him on edge.</p><p>Something similar to what he always sensed in me.</p><p>Icy fear raced through me, almost&#x2014;but not quite&#x2014;eradicating the lovely bliss of Lissa&#x2019;s bite. Backing up from the window, I jerked on a pair of jeans that I found on the floor, nearly falling over in the process. Once they were on, I grabbed my coat and Lissa&#x2019;s, along with our wallets. Shoving my feet into the first shoes I saw, I headed out the door.</p><p>Downstairs, I found her in the cramped kitchen, rummaging through the refrigerator. One of our housemates, Jeremy, sat at the table, hand on his forehead as he stared sadly at a calculus book. Lissa regarded me with surprise.</p><p>&#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t be up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We have to go. Now.&#x201d;</p><p>Her eyes widened, and then a moment later, understanding clicked in. &#x201c;Are you . . . really? Are you sure?&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded. I couldn&#x2019;t explain how I knew for sure. I just did.</p><p>Jeremy watched us curiously. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;</p><p>An idea came to mind. &#x201c;Liss, get his car keys.&#x201d;</p><p>He looked back and forth between us. &#x201c;What are you&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Lissa unhesitatingly walked over to him. Her fear poured into me through our psychic bond, but there was something else too: her complete faith that I would take care of everything, that we would be safe. Like always, I hoped I was worthy of that kind of trust.</p><p>She smiled broadly and gazed directly into his eyes. For a moment, Jeremy just stared, still confused, and then I saw the thrall seize him. His eyes glazed over, and he regarded her adoringly.</p><p>&#x201c;We need to borrow your car,&#x201d; she said in a gentle voice. &#x201c;Where are your keys?&#x201d;</p><p>He smiled, and I shivered. I had a high resistance to compulsion, but I could still feel its effects when it was directed at another person. That, and I&#x2019;d been taught my entire life that using it was wrong. Reaching into his pocket, Jeremy handed over a set of keys hanging on a large red key chain.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; said Lissa. &#x201c;And where is it parked?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Down the street,&#x201d; he said dreamily. &#x201c;At the corner. By Brown.&#x201d; Four blocks away.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; she repeated, backing up. &#x201c;As soon as we leave, I want you to go back to studying. Forget you ever saw us tonight.&#x201d;</p><p>He nodded obligingly. I got the impression he would have walked off a cliff for her right then if she&#x2019;d asked. All humans were susceptible to compulsion, but Jeremy appeared weaker than most. That came in handy right now.</p><p>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got to move.&#x201d;</p><p>We stepped outside, heading toward the corner he&#x2019;d named. I was still dizzy from the bite and kept stumbling, unable to move as quickly as I wanted. Lissa had to catch hold of me a few times to stop me from falling. All the time, that anxiety rushed into me from her mind. I tried my best to ignore it; I had my own fears to deal with.</p><p>&#x201c;Rose . . . what are we going to do if they catch us?&#x201d; she whispered.</p><p>&#x201c;They won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; I said fiercely. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t let them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But if they&#x2019;ve found us&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They found us before. They didn&#x2019;t catch us then. We&#x2019;ll just drive over to the train station and go to L.A. They&#x2019;ll lose the trail.&#x201d;</p><p>I made it sound simple. I always did, even though there was nothing simple about being on the run from the people we&#x2019;d grown up with. We&#x2019;d been doing it for two years, hiding wherever we could and just trying to finish high school. Our senior year had just started, and living on a college campus had seemed safe. We were so close to freedom.</p><p>She said nothing more, and I felt her faith in me surge up once more. This was the way it had always been between us. I was the one who took action, who made sure things happened&#x2014;sometimes recklessly so. She was the more reasonable one, the one who thought things out and researched them extensively before acting. Both styles had their uses, but at the moment, recklessness was called for. We didn&#x2019;t have time to hesitate.</p><p>Lissa and I had been best friends ever since kindergarten, when our teacher had paired us together for writing lessons. Forcing five-year-olds to spell <i>Vasilisa Dragomir </i>and <i>Rosemarie Hathaway </i>was beyond cruel, and we&#x2019;d&#x2014;or rather, <i>I&#x2019;d</i>&#x2014;responded appropriately. I&#x2019;d chucked my book at our teacher and called her a fascist bastard. I hadn&#x2019;t known what those words meant, but I&#x2019;d known how to hit a moving target.</p><p>Lissa and I had been inseparable ever since.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you hear that?&#x201d; she asked suddenly.</p><p>It took me a few seconds to pick up what her sharper senses already had. Footsteps, moving fast. I grimaced. We had two more blocks to go.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got to run for it,&#x201d; I said, catching hold of her arm.</p><p>&#x201c;But you can&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Run</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>It took every ounce of my willpower not to pass out on the sidewalk. My body didn&#x2019;t want to run after losing blood or while still metabolizing the effects of her saliva. But I ordered my muscles to stop their bitching and clung to Lissa as our feet pounded against the concrete. Normally I could have outrun her without any extra effort&#x2014;particularly since she was barefoot&#x2014;but tonight, she was all that held me upright.</p><p>The pursuing footsteps grew louder, closer. Black stars danced before my eyes. Ahead of us, I could make out Jeremy&#x2019;s green Honda. Oh God, if we could just make it&#x2014;</p><p>Ten feet from the car, a man stepped directly into our path. We came to a screeching halt, and I jerked Lissa back by her arm. It was <i>him</i>, the guy I&#x2019;d seen across the street watching me. He was older than us, maybe mid-twenties, and as tall as I&#x2019;d figured, probably six-six or six-seven. And under different circumstances&#x2014;say, when he wasn&#x2019;t holding up our desperate escape&#x2014;I would have thought he was hot. Shoulder-length brown hair, tied back into a short ponytail. Dark brown eyes. A long brown coat like horse riders wore, not quite a trench coat. A duster, I thought it was called.</p><p>But his hotness was irrelevant now. He was only an obstacle keeping Lissa and me away from the car and our freedom. The footsteps behind us slowed, and I knew our pursuers had caught up. Off to the sides, I detected more movement, more people closing in. God. They&#x2019;d sent almost a dozen guardians to retrieve us. I couldn&#x2019;t believe it. The queen herself didn&#x2019;t travel with that many.</p><p>Panicked and not entirely in control of my higher reasoning, I acted out of instinct. I pressed up to Lissa, keeping her behind me and away from the man who appeared to be the leader.</p><p>&#x201c;Leave her alone,&#x201d; I growled. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t touch her.&#x201d;</p><p>His face was unreadable, but he held out his hands in what was apparently supposed to be some sort of calming gesture, like I was a rabid animal he was planning to sedate.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>He took a step forward. Too close.</p><p>I attacked him, leaping out in an offensive maneuver I hadn&#x2019;t used in two years, not since Lissa and I had run away. The move was stupid, another reaction born of instinct and fear. And it was hopeless. He was a skilled guardian, not a novice who hadn&#x2019;t finished his training. He also wasn&#x2019;t weak and on the verge of passing out.And man, was he fast. I&#x2019;d forgotten how fast guardians could be, how they could move and strike like cobras. He knocked me off as though brushing away a fly, and his hands slammed into me and sent me backwards. I don&#x2019;t think he meant to strike that hard&#x2014;probably just intended to keep me away&#x2014;but my lack of coordination interfered with my ability to respond. Unable to catch my footing, I started to fall, heading straight toward the sidewalk at a twisted angle, hip-first. It was going to hurt. A <i>t</i></p><p>Only it didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>Just as quickly as he&#x2019;d blocked me, the man reached out and caught my arm, keeping me upright. When I&#x2019;d steadied myself, I noticed he was staring at me&#x2014;or, more precisely, at my neck. Still disoriented, I didn&#x2019;t get it right away. Then, slowly, my free hand reached up to the side of my throat and lightly touched the wound Lissa had made earlier. </p><p>When I pulled my fingers back, I saw slick, dark blood on my skin. Embarrassed, I shook my hair so that it fell forward around my face. It was thick and long and completely covered my neck. I&#x2019;d grown it out for precisely this reason.</p><p>The guy&#x2019;s dark eyes lingered on the now-covered bite a moment longer and then met mine. I returned his look defiantly and quickly jerked out of his hold. He let me go, though I knew he could have restrained me all night if he&#x2019;d wanted. Fighting the nauseating dizziness, I backed toward Lissa again, bracing myself for another attack. Suddenly, her hand caught hold of mine. &#x201c;Rose,&#x201d; she said quietly. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>Her words had no effect on me at first, but calming thoughts gradually began to settle in my mind, coming across through the bond. It wasn&#x2019;t exactly compulsion&#x2014;she wouldn&#x2019;t use that on me&#x2014;but it was effectual, as w...</p></p><h2>Letters from Egypt: A Journey on the Nile, 1849-1850</h2><p>A collection of letters written during a journey to Egypt describing the author&#39;s views on the country and its history and people</p><p>"Yes, my dear people, I have set my first footfall in the East, and oh! that I could tell you the new world of old poetry, of Bible images, of light, and life, and beauty which that word opens." <p>Florence Nightingale was twenty-nine when she visited Egypt in the winter of 1849-50 with her friends Charles and Selina Bracebridge. A journey to the fabled land of the Arabian Nights was a fantastic adventure at that time, and Florence wrote long, picturesque letters to her family describing her visit and her views of the country, its history and its people.

In November 1849 she spent five months sailing from Alexandria to Abu Simbel and back. On that journey she wrote many letters to her family in England, vividly and in great detail describing the ruins, the environment, the lives of the people, and the politics of Egypt. The letters were "circulated" by her sister in 1854 and are now published for the first time. Many sketches and colored paintings of 19th-century Egypt appropriately illustrate the narrative.

After a suspicious autopsy and a rushed burial, friends had Aquash exhumed and found a .32-caliber bullet in her skull.<br><br>Using this scandal as a point of departure, <i>The Unquiet Grave</i> opens a tunnel into the dark side of the FBI and its subversion of American Indian activists.

Bracketed by the 1976 murder of AIM activist Anna Mae Aquash and the 2004 trial related to it, Hendricks's swift narrative is riddled with judicial travesties, coverups, vigilantism, COINTELPRO-style tactics, mounting paranoia and lawlessness on both sides, as activists and ordinary American Indians confront the devastating neglect and outright hostility of government authorities. Based on reams of newly released official documents (many the result of the author's own Freedom of Information Act lawsuits) and interviews with many surviving actors and witnesses, the book's committed journalism doesn't leave its sympathies in doubt, while also holding AIM's militants responsible for their actions. Hendricks is careful throughout this harsh, heart-thumping account never to lose sight of the larger context. "Aquash," he persuasively reminds us, "was murdered because the government of the United States waged an officially sanctioned, covert war on the country's foremost movement for Indian rights." <i>(Sept. 1)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Faber Finds are reissuing his four volume The Pride and Fall sequence: The Collapse of British Power, The Audit of War, The Lost Victory, The Verdict of Peace, as well as The Swordbearers, Britain and her Army, 1509-1970 (winner of the Royal Society of Literature Heinemann Award) and Engage the Enemy More Closely (winner of the Yorkshire Post Book of the Year Award).This is the story of the heroic twilight of a fleet and an empire. The Royal Navy of 1939 was the creation of governments that had hoped in vain for security on the cheap. From Norway to Crete and from Singapore to the Atlantic, the Royal Navy fought a rearguard action for a Britain no longer able to fulfill its imperial obligations. Only with the U.S. entry into the war in 1941 were British admirals able to take time to prepare strategies and concentrate forces--albeit as the junior partner of the Grand Alliance. Barnett is a superb narrator as well as a perceptive analyst. He tells a series of gripping stories relatively unfamiliar to American readers: the destroyer raid on Narvik, the epic battle of the Malta convoys, the airstrike against Taranto that crippled Italy's battle fleet. He pays tribute to sailors as well as admirals. The junior officers and men who crewed the ships that won superiority on the Atlantic, and in Europe's coastal waters, were worthy successors to the victors of Trafalgar. Never in its long history has the Royal Navy performed more gallantly and effectively than in World War II. Recommended for all collections.<br><i>- Dennis E.

He felt undeserving of the wealth and fame he had accumulated, while millions around him were illiterate and afflicted, and therefore sought an acceptable faith wherein he could find the answers to life&#39;s most profound questions. In this autobiographical work of exceptional emotional honesty, he records his various attempts to find those answers in areas of science, philosophy, eastern wisdom, and the opinions of his fellow novelists. As a result of this process, Tolstoy recognizes in ordinary people a deep religious conviction, in which he may find the true answers to questions without which life, to him, is impossible. This collection includes Tolstoy&#39;s &#34;Confession&#34; as well as the following three other religious essays: &#34;What is religion? and What is its Essence?&#34;, &#34;Religion and Morality&#34;, and &#34;The Law of Violence and The Law of Love.&#34;</p><p><b>Count Leo Tolstoy</b>&nbsp;was born on September 9, 1828, in Yasnaya Polyana, Russia. Orphaned at nine, he was brought up by an elderly aunt and educated by French tutors until he matriculated at Kazan University in 1844. In 1847, he gave up his studies and, after several aimless years, volunteered for military duty in the army, serving as a junior officer in the Crimean War before retiring in 1857. In 1862, Tolstoy married Sophie Behrs, a marriage that was to become, for him, bitterly unhappy. His diary, started in 1847, was used for self-study and self-criticism; it served as the source from which he drew much of the material that appeared not only in his great novels&nbsp;<i>War and Peace&nbsp;</i>(1869) and&nbsp;<i>Anna Karenina</i>(1877), but also in his shorter works. Seeking religious justification for his life, Tolstoy evolved a new Christianity based upon his own interpretation of the Gospels. Yasnaya Polyana became a mecca for his many converts. At the age of eighty-two, while away from home, the writer suffered a break down in his health in Astapovo, Riazan, and he died there on November 20, 1910.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Russian</p><h2>Henry James Goes to Paris</h2><p><p>Henry James's reputation as The Master is so familiar that it's hard to imagine he was ever someone on whom some things really were lost. This is the story of the year--1875 to 1876--when the young novelist moved to Paris, drawn by his literary idols living at the center of the early modern movement in art. As Peter Brooks skillfully recounts, James largely failed to appreciate or even understand the new artistic developments teeming around him during his Paris sojourn. But living in England twenty years later, he would recall the aesthetic lessons of Paris, and his memories of the radical perspectives opened up by French novelists and painters would help transform James into the writer of his adventurous later fiction. A narrative that combines biography and criticism and uses James's writings to tell the story from his point of view, <i>Henry James Goes to Paris</i> vividly brings to life the young American artist's Paris year--and its momentous artistic and personal consequences.</p><br><p> James's Paris story is one of enchantment and disenchantment. He initially loved Paris, he succeeded in meeting all the writers he admired (Turgenev, Flaubert, Zola, Maupassant, Goncourt, and Daudet), and he witnessed the latest development in French painting, Impressionism. But James largely found the writers disappointing, and he completely misunderstood the paintings he saw. He also seems to have fallen in and out of love in a more ordinary sense--with a young Russian aesthete, Paul Zhukovsky. Disillusioned, James soon retreated to England--for good. But James would eventually be changed forever by his memories of Paris.</p></p><p><p>"Under the guise of simply 'telling a story' about the young Henry James's stay in Paris in 1875-76, Peter Brooks describes the progressive emergence of the whole of novelistic modernity during the turn from the nineteenth to the twentieth century. You have to be, like Brooks, both historian and theorist, a scholar both of things French and American, to so masterfully carry out this project."--<b>Philippe Hamon, Professor Emeritus, La Sorbonne Nouvelle</b></p><p>"<i>Henry James Goes to Paris</i> is a delight to read. Peter Brooks writes with much grace and with an intimate knowledge of James's novels and of the French masters (Flaubert, the Goncourt brothers, Zola) James came to know during his stay in Paris in 1875-76. The central theme of this wide-ranging and original study is James's early misunderstanding and even misreading of the French avant-garde writers that in time, however, contributed to his mature vision of the art of the novel. Brooks treats his subject with much subtlety, solid scholarship, and flexibility of mind."--<b>Victor Brombert, author of <i>Trains of Thought</i></b></p><p>"This critical narrative about James's relations with Paris and the circle of writers he encountered when he took up residence there in 1875 is a great pleasure to read. What makes it especially attractive is the fact that Brooks relies so heavily on primary documents. We have the illusion of learning about James directly, often in his own words. Most people today do not read criticism. They read narrative, and that's why biography is so popular. Yet to the degree that criticism can find a narrative form, it will find readers outside a narrow range of specialists. I expect this book to do that."--<b>Michael Gorra, author of <i>The Bells in Their Silence: Travels through Germany</i></b></p><p>"This is a thoroughly well-crafted, nuanced, and very Jamesian story about cross-cultural contact, modernity, and how one fine mind assimilated the most advanced (if not necessarily the 'best') artistic theories of his day. The result is a live picture of a crucial moment in the development of the novel."--<b>Nicholas Dames, Columbia University</b></p><b>Peter Brooks</b> is the Mellon Visiting Professor at Princeton University.

I always thought Mom was a silver screen kind of beauty because of that picture of her in high school: blonde, dimples, all clean-looking. But in this show she&#x2019;s dark-sexy, her hair colored a deep brunette, silky bedsheets held up around her neck with gold ribbons. Mom left Pieria when I was a kid. Grammy would say it was because she needed to go be Aphrodite on the TV. I know that it&#x2019;s because she was tired of it all, of the town and the people. So she disappeared one night. She only told Grammy as she was walking out the door. I was two.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> In the car on the way to church this morning, I write Sarah&#x2019;s name in the condensation on the passenger&#x2019;s window, then wipe it off before Grammy can see.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car is a worn-down blue Volvo from the seventies. It&#x2019;s a miracle it&#x2019;s still running. Every time Grammy slides the key in the ignition and it actually starts, she thanks God under her breath. The seat belts are frayed so much that they could snap if you pulled too hard, so we stopped using them. I have to hold onto the car door to keep from falling out of my seat every time Grammy brakes. She drives like a maniac. Runs over mailboxes on a regular basis, hits curbs, mows down shrubs. Once she ran over an abandoned lemonade stand. She never stops to deal with what she&#x2019;s run over, just keeps going, like she&#x2019;s late on her way to somewhere really important.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> I get through the service like I always do: running myths through my head. Ever since I found my mom playing Aphrodite on that soap opera, I&#x2019;ve been memorizing them. I know it&#x2019;s stupid, but I&#x2019;ve always thought that one day I&#x2019;ll open the door and she&#x2019;ll be there, and I&#x2019;ll need something to talk about. And since my mom&#x2019;s Aphrodite, I might as well be able to talk about myths. During the service I think about Persephone, how the girl was pulled away from everything she&#x2019;d ever known and taken to a strange world. Or Atalanta. In these myths, girls are always being changed or taken by men, their voices, their protests ignored. And the queer girls, like Atalanta, are forced to become something else.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grammy&#x2019;s always talking about how one day I&#x2019;ll have a normal life, with a husband and two kids (a boy and a girl) and a brick house with a white picket fence and a big yellow dog who&#x2019;ll run around the yard. She says my husband should work so I don&#x2019;t have to, and I&#x2019;ll stay home all day and make cookies the way she taught me and go to PTA meetings and church. Whenever she talks about it, she gets a misty look in her eyes and twists the gold chain of her cross necklace between her fingers, and I know it&#x2019;s not my life she&#x2019;s imagining, that secretly she&#x2019;s wondering what would have happened if her own husband hadn&#x2019;t died in a car accident at twenty-seven and left her with a two-year-old girl, if her girl hadn&#x2019;t gotten pregnant senior year of high school only to run off three years later.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, she still has a job arranging and delivering flowers for weddings and funerals and baptisms, continual reminders of her own wedding and her husband&#x2019;s service, and she makes me go to cotillions and dance with boys, refuses to let me wear pants to school, and makes me go to church three times a week and Bible camp in the summer and try out for cheerleading every August.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Every fall since fourth grade, she&#x2019;s bought me a new pair of shiny green pom-poms. She takes the day off work to come to the tryouts with me. I walk into the gym with a lump in my throat, but I never can kick high enough or land lightly enough, and every year we drive home together in disappointed silence. When we get home, Grammy always says she has a &#x201c;headache worse than Satan,&#x201d; and she goes upstairs to lie down and change out of the &#x201c;Go Team!&#x201d; sweatshirt she wears just for tryouts. We both know that her head&#x2019;s not hurting, that she just doesn&#x2019;t want to have to pretend not to be let down yet again, but I always nod and don&#x2019;t say anything.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year, before she went upstairs, she said, &#x201c;You were supposed to be my second chance.&#x201d; But she said it so quietly I think I wasn&#x2019;t supposed to hear her.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then we&#x2019;ve never talked about tryouts again. I think maybe she finally just gave up.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Once the service ends, I heap pastries and the little watercress-and-pickle and peanut-butter tea sandwiches that the church ladies make onto my plate, then sit down on the coffee-stained couch outside Preacher Sam&#x2019;s office and eat until I feel sick. Every time I go to Sarah&#x2019;s dad&#x2019;s church I get this sinking feeling, like something&#x2019;s wrong with me and if they find out, when they find out, it&#x2019;s all over.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Most nights I dream that Sarah and the choir boys and Preacher Sam are peering down at me. I&#x2019;m wearing another girl&#x2019;s clothes but I don&#x2019;t know why. When Preacher Sam hands me a crucifix, my skin starts burning and wings burst out of my back, and I&#x2019;m trying to get the wings to stop sprouting from my back but they won&#x2019;t, and soon I&#x2019;m screaming and burning and they&#x2019;re whispering &#x201c;freak&#x201d; and then they&#x2019;re yelling it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The dreams started when I was eight, shortly after I realized I was different from the girls I went to school with, but I didn&#x2019;t yet know how, just that there was some strange and invisible barrier separating me from them. Often, at after-school church camp, I&#x2019;d watch the girls running around, skipping rope or drawing on the pavement outside the church, and my back would ache for reasons I could never discern. On those days, I tried to pinpoint the difference, the thing separating me, causing me to feel like every movement I made was an act, a dream that I would wake up from, like a fortune-teller sifting her tea leaves, trying to gather together some foreign objects and principles into a crystalline answer. But for years the bowl would come back empty, nothing more than water and stray oolong straining to reach the surface.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> When I was born, I had two small, misplaced vertebrae sticking out of my back. They looked like wings. The doctors took pictures, then set the vertebrae back in place. Now I just have two bumps and a line of scars on my back. Sometimes at night, I run my fingers over the bumps, try to imagine what the wings would have looked like. The doctors made the first incision in my vertebrae, so the worst of the scars are low on my back, though the scar tissue maps all the way up to my shoulders in a messy sprawl. The doctors said I healed better than expected. They&#x2019;d thought I&#x2019;d be disfigured. But I just don&#x2019;t wear bikinis like the other girls, always make sure my tops don&#x2019;t slip down past my shoulder blades. I don&#x2019;t need anyone else thinking about my being different even more than they already do. I don&#x2019;t want to cause any suspicion&#x2014;at least not any more suspicion than being motherless in a little town already creates.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The only time that Grammy ever acknowledged my scars was once when I was ten. I was standing in front of the bathroom mirror staring at the faded-to-pale lines, watching the ruined skin ripple when I moved. I remember trying not to cry when I saw how ugly it was, how the marks of what was once a wound, a defect, covered me. I&#x2019;d never paid much notice to the scars before, had always just considered them a part of me, normal, but the day before, Sarah and I had gone swimming, and when she&#x2019;d crouched at the edge of the pool before diving in, I saw the smooth stretch of her back, her unscarred shoulders, the skin taut and gold from the sun, and a hard lump of something akin to shame worked its way into my throat and made it hard to swallow.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later that night, alone in the house, I prepared to try to find a way to make myself beautiful too, to try to rid myself of the ruined thing inside of me&#x2014;the constant gnawing feeling that I was hiding something, that some part of my girlhood, and my body itself, was defective, wrong. But there was no way to get rid of the scars, no way to remove the proof that I was different than the other, unmarred girls I grew up with.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember clawing at the scars, as if I could scrape the ugliness away, as if I could cleanse it out of myself from the outside in. When that didn&#x2019;t work, I scrubbed at my back with a washcloth I&#x2019;d covered with dish soap. I was getting hysterical by then, my face screwed up with panic. My skin was flushed with shame and I was crying so hard that I didn&#x2019;t hear her come in, but when I looked up she was in the<br> doorway, watching.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grammy knelt down on the bathroom floor so that we were at eye level, and she grabbed both of my hands in hers. My fingers were bloody from scratching the skin around the scars, and the blood smeared into a faint red on her palms. She stared at me for a minute, like she was trying to remember something she hadn&#x2019;t recalled for years, and then she cleared her throat. &#x201c;Raya, this is God&#x2019;s doing. He makes everything in his image, you know. And so he gave you these wings, like an angel. You know, when you were born, the parts of your back they had to take out looked just like a baby bird&#x2019;s. He made you in his image; he made you like him. And you need to accept that.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though I never put much weight in God, from then on, whenever I saw the scars, that feeling of disgust that had always risen up in my mouth like bile whenever I saw my body was replaced with a kind of grudging acceptance: Grammy said they were beautiful, that I was marked for some reason, that maybe my being here wasn&#x2019;t as much of an accident as I&#x2019;d always felt like it was, and I thought that maybe that could be enough.</p><h2>The Real Thing: A Comedy in Two Acts</h2><p>The play begins with Max and Charlotte, a couple whose marriage seems about to rupture.

Max, her leading man, is also married to an actress, Annie. Both marriages are at the point of rupture because Henry and Annie have fallen in love. But is it the real thing?

Smith's vibrant sponge-paint illustrations and use of unusual collective nouns such as<i> smack</i> and <i>unkindness</i> bring the book to life. Whimsical, expressive, and perfectly paced, this story plays with language as much as it embodies imagination, and was awarded the 2017 Kate Greenaway Medal.</p><p>This title has Common Core connections.</p></p><p>There is a shelf of books by <b>Lane Smith</b>. The 2012 Caldecott Honor book <i>Grandpa Green</i>, as well as <i>It's a Book</i>, and the middle grade novel <i>Return to Augie Hobble</i> dwell there, among others. In 2012, the Eric Carle Museum named him a Carle Artist for "lifelong innovation in the field of children's picture books," and in 2014, he was awarded the lifetime achievement award from the Society of Illustrators. In 2017, he was awared the Kate Greenaway Medal for <i>There is a Tribe of Kids</i>. He lives in an old house in Connecticut with the designer Molly Leach and a scurry of flying squirrels.PreS-Gr 3&#x2014;Here, Smith mines the humor and surprises found in the collective nouns assigned to groups of things and animals, juggling a host of habitats in a 24-hour time period. Arrayed in pixielike footwear and a leafy tunic, his protagonist is constantly moving&#x2014;falling mid-flight from an "unkindness of ravens" or transforming into a trapezoid to mimic the "formation of rocks." The interactions are, by turn, affectionate, dramatic, and funny&#x2014;developed through expert shifts in expression, gesture, and posture. Witness the water swelling and lifting the lad's clothing, revealing matching underwear as he cavorts with the "smack of jellyfish" or the stare down from the "band of gorillas" when he plays a sour note. The artist has honed his technique of manual and digital manipulation of oil paint, sprayed varnish, and colored pencils to create a visual extravaganza of dappled, textured compositions; their changing palettes create colors ranging from the dazzling whiteness behind a "colony of penguins" to the restful blues enveloping the nocturnal "bed of clams." A shift from past to present tense upon the return home, plus the second use (new meaning) of "a tribe of kids," contrasts a raucous, Pan-like forest civilization with the quiet goats that opened the story. VERDICT There is much to savor and explore in this cleverly crafted picture book, and readers will glean more with each perusal.
